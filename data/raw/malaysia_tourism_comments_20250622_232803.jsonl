OP mentioned there’s a 12-month solvency fund outside of EPF, so it’s not even putting everything into EPF. Stop saying “don’t put everything into EPF”, it is common knowledge by now. And “don’t put anything into EPF” is also wrong due to high dividends return. Now back to the question, if you’re 9 month into unemployment, I think it’s really a you problem in today’s market. Assuming you’re able to both contribute extra into EPF, and built a 12-month solvency fund outside of EPF at the same time, you are probably somewhat experienced in your field. You can definitely take a pay cut and cut short your unemployment. If it is an industry specific issue, look elsewhere and do something else - it’s easier than you think, especially when you have a minimum 12-month cushion over many others. And if it’s a country/global specific issue like recession, then take comfort that you are not alone in this and the government likely allow partial withdrawal. Also, if anyone is 1-2 months into unemployment, they should definitely cut back on their lifestyle to accommodate the loss of income, until it is back on.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhfr5h", "score": 12, "created_date": "2025-06-22T06:11:25+00:00", "author": "ghim7", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1lhfr5h/what_if_you_save_a_lot_in_epf_but_cant_touch_it/mz40s1h/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1167, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:28:24.885759+00:00"}

The question that the border officer will have to answer is if you’ve been totally rehabilitated or “if the conviction is spent” from an Irish immigration standpoint.

NYC is obviously much bigger. The touristy stuff in Chicago is much more centralized. But both have respectable public transit. You absolutely don’t need a car in either city. Both very walkable. Chicago has nice green space but nothing that compares to Central Park. Architecture is going to be a big draw here. Chicago has the lakefront though, which is a big plus. I prefer the food scene overall in Chicago. Cheap eats are plentiful, and finer dining to me is more accessible. Both cities have their own good local stuff and great versions of myriad international cuisines. Opinions will probably skew toward NYC here, and I’m just overall more familiar with dining in Chicago. Loads of good nightlife and entertainment options in both if you like to party or want to see any music, comedy, theater, etc. Costs are going to be lower in Chicago, especially when it comes to hotels. Vibes-wise, NYC is more vibrant and alive. Not many other places like it. Chicago also has great vibes but you’ll find that more in the neighborhoods away from the touristy part. NYC is one of the greatest cities in the world. So is Chicago but in a different way. Visiting NYC for the first time changed my life in some ways.

I really love Chicago, it’s the perfect size for me, it’s a city but feels comfortable intimate if that makes sense. New York is too large for my tastes. A lot of the main tourist attractions are downtown and walkable although the walk can be 45+ minutes (for example Shedd to Navy Pier) but you walk along the lake so the walk is generally pleasant. Types of activities really depend on what you’re interested in - Millennium Park with the Bean, Pritzker Pavilion and Crown Fountain; across the street is the Art Institute. Walk further south and you can get to Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum, and Adler Planetarium; want pure tourist kitsch with beautiful views of the skyline? Walk north along the lake to Navy Pier. There’s also all the waterways. The lake borders the entire eastern side of the city and offers sandy beaches and a cool breeze. You can take an architecture tour to learn about the city and its history or just grab a water taxi, I like to take one from downtown to Chinatown instead of the L when it’s available. Want to explore less touristy areas/get out of downtown? Hop on a bus or train and go into one of the neighborhoods- my recommendation for tourists is Pilsen - the National Museum of Mexican Art is fantastic, one of my favorite museums and of course there are all the murals throughout the neighborhood, dozens of Mexican restaurants to choose from. There’s always the breweries if you like to drink - there are a couple downtown but the ***good*** ones are in the neighborhoods and which one you should check out depends on what style you lean towards (I have a whole list of recommendations if that’s an interest) If you’re there in the summer and it’s a weekend there will be a street festival somewhere in Chicago with live music and food, Chicagoans love to be outside in the summer because winter is so cold and long. Foodwise, again that depends on your tastes - there’s the city specific and regional dishes - deep dish, Chicago hot dog, Italian beef, etc but there’s also almost anything and everything else, so recommendations just depend on what you want to eat and how much you want to spend. Public transportation- it’s pretty convenient and reasonably priced.

And one unexpected thing was while you’re walking, you’ll recognize so many things you’ve seen in movies, TV, etc. since NYC is so big in pop culture - that alone was worth it, it felt almost like how I imagine Europeans feel visiting the US for the first time As for Chicago, if you want a less busy city with better beaches and more centralized attractions, you might like it better.

Alicante city, is a very touristy city, so won't be a problem finding stuff to see or do. A nice visit in my opinion, and can easily spend several days there. I went on a guided tour in the city, I don't remember the name .. but something like \"tasting tour of Alicante\" - it started in the Mercat Central, and included a water and a taste of local pork and cheese (I think it was), then a bus trip to the fort, and ending at a small cafe that also included a small sandwich .. So it was very worth the price. Altea, a small town east of Alicante, along the coast. Some friends in the area (from Alcoy) recommended it. A very beautiful town. Steep roads though. I didn't spend much time there so I cannot really give a review tbh. El Castell de Guadalest. Northwest'ish of Altea. An old fort on top of a mountain peak .. sort of. Interesting place. Would say it is worth it if you are in the area anyway. Very touristy. Felt like half the town was just parking for cars, and so many souvenir shops - not that that's a bad thing, unless you tend to focus on that stuff.. Alcoy, the reason for my visit in the area. I went a couple of times for business reasons and to visit friends. A small city north of Alicante on the main road to Valencia. It is not at tourist city - not many speak English there, but a Translate App or if you speak (Castilian) Spanish you'll be fine, plus everyone is very friendly. They do though mainly speak Valencian there.. IMO, it's a really nice city. Very different from cities here in Denmark, which maybe makes it more interesting to me. Situated in a valley with a (dry'ish) river running through. So, many bridges and also steep roads. Painful to drive there, but small enough to walk. But.. like I said it is not a big tourist place, so not a lot of \"must see\" stuff.

I think it's easier to have (touristy) experiences unique to the place you're traveling to. Cons: you're on their schedule.

Solo travel Pros: everything is your choice (sights to see, scheduling, choice of restaurant), more peaceful, more opportunity to chat with local people Cons: takes more of your time to plan, more pressure if you're picking the right things (you are, lol), you may feel lonely at times, no one to share new experiences with, language may be an issue at times (but not too big a deal). I've gone on 3 GAP Adventures trips (Rwanda/Uganda, Central Asia, and Antarctica) and 1 Exodus trip (cycling in Romania. I enjoyed the trips with both companies and thought they were good. They each have lots of options. My tip would be to book a couple extra days at the start and end points of the tour so you have time to explore there on your own (you may never return there again). I've also planned my own, multi-week trips (Paris, Scotland, Italy, Vienna, Vietnam, Phnom Penh, South Africa, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Chile, Colombia, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, etc.). The way I plan is 1) pick the place I want to go, 2) buy airline/train tickets (between cities), 3) buy hotels, 4) pick sights to visit. Sometimes I research these things all together. Resources that I use to research: ask friends/acquaintances who've visited there, check itineraries online from the aforementioned tour groups, guidebooks (I check them out from library and then maybe purchase one that I thought was good), and Internet. For the Internet, I've found Adventurous Kate and Nomadic Matt especially helpful. But there are lots of useful sites. For guidebooks, I like Rough Guides, Lonely Planet, and I really like Rick Steves (for Europe). Check out his website too. The main things I buy in advance are the plane tix, hotel, and attractions that you must pre-book or you don't want to miss out on. I don't necessarily schedule out my day to day activities. For most things, I just have a list of a few things I want to do in that city, but I don't schedule them in advance. I just refer to my list the day before or morning of and pick what I want to do that day", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lgwe2r", "score": 2, "created_date": "2025-06-21T16:27:52+00:00", "author": "Ok-Hyena5037", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lgwe2r/looking_for_insight/mz0b3fk/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2685, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:29:27.242002+00:00"}

I had fun, met good people. It's super fast-paced, but I think that it's inherent to the package that we chose (10 days, 7 countries). They offer a selection of add-on side trips you can pay extra for, and I did sign up for a few of them. Worth the cost! Anyway, I'm using Globus again. I have the same reasons as yours...first trip alone and I want a group tour where everything is planned out, and it feels safer to travel with a group too. I have horrible sense of direction, so traveling in a place where English might not be spoken widely might be an issue for me. The hotels, breakfast, most dinners and transportation transfers are covered by the package cost. I think they can arrange your flight too, should you ask. I had my travel agent do that for me.

Also ask them what the age profile of their customers is on that trip, if that’s important to you.

If you go to small villages you can be welcomed \"as family\". But I guess you have been to touristic places where people are quite rude. Even if most of the economy relies on tourism, they don't like tourists. Thing with Germans (as Austrian they probably took you for a German) is that about 15 years ago, some German tourist book started to list the places like river holes for swimming where locals used to go with family for chilling during summer. As a child I spent lots of summers in Corsica and our main activities were hiking and spending the afternoon at the river to swimm. Now, it's impossible to go because it's full of German tourists. So locals feel (rightfully) they can't enjoy their spots anymore. This is why they don't like Germans Another reason and why Germans in particular, is many German tourists come with big cars and don't know how to drive in sinuous mountain roads. Locals don't mind backing up near the cliff but you see in summer a huge traffic jam because a tourist is too scared to do so with their pristine SUV. Frenchs from \"the continent\" still do better than central Europeans. Thus the hate for German cars in particular. It's attached to the stereotype of \"this guy gonna cause a traffic jam and I will be late again for work\" The problem is overtourism in Corsica. And German tourists are, for some reasons, seen as the ones outplacing locals. Tourists also outprice locals by buying secondary houses and there is a huge economic crisis there. Locals have low pay jobs and can't live in their village anymore. Now for the culture, it's an island. People from cities are rude because too much tourism. People from villages will be welcoming tourists but not if you plan to stay for long and are not from there for 5 generations. There is some quite backward mentalities. I experienced rudeness, and people completely changing their attitude when I give my mom's name (Corsican) rather than my last name (not Corsican)", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lgcue1", "score": 39, "created_date": "2025-06-21T18:06:59+00:00", "author": "MerberCrazyCats", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lgcue1/creepy_corsica/mz0u6mh/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2055, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:29:31.439164+00:00"}

I felt Chongqing had more things to see than Chengdu and felt a lot bigger. I think Shenzhen and Guangzhou are skippable as a tourist. You need to book tickets to the Nanjing massacre museum in advance as they sell out. In Shanghai if you don’t want to pay to go up the tallest building, there is the tallest restaurant, Heavenly Jin, which some people take the elevator up to “browse the menu” and take photos. It will help with your planning to include the train travel times as this will impact how long you spend in each place. For example, you might say Guilin for two days but I would suggest arriving day 1, two full days for activities then leave day 4. Also some days will be fully taken up by the train journey / getting to the hotel. Chinese airports tend be very efficient and may work out similar price to trains btw. I used trip.com to book my trains as they will automatically try and book your preferred train as soon as it goes on sale two weeks before the travel date. If they bought a ticket you don’t want them you can just cancel it after and try and find your own one (12306 is the app most people will recommend but it’s a bit more difficult for English speakers).

I heard about flights being as affordable as trains but I very much prefer travelling by train, it's my favourite means of transport by far and from what I could read, the train travelling experience in China is truly world class.

You really have to pay attention, much more than in other countries where there are simple a lot less bicycles. One memory was a park with a no-cycling sign at the entrance. Unfortunately, there were no free bike parking spaces in front of it (finding bike parking spaces was generally a problem), so I simply took my bike with me as a pedestrian, pushing it alongside me. At home, there are also parks where cycling is prohibited, but of course everyone does it anyway, and pushing is legal anyway. But not in Copenhagen. Pretty quickly, an employee came over and very rudely told me I had to leave the park immediately – because bicycles are absolutely prohibited, even if you're not riding them.

Singapore is expensive but you can make it work if you budget accordingly. Eat at hawker centres for $5-$10 a meal depending on where you go, what you eat, and how much you eat. That will be $30 max if you eat three solid meals a day. Public transport will be about $5-$7. It's only hostels or hotels in Singapore, there are no airbnbs. The average dorm is about $35 a night per person from what I can see on Hostelworld. Hotels are expensive but I guess you'll split the cost with your cousins. Free attractions: walking along Orchard Road, city parks (e.g. Fort Canning Park, Pearl's Hill), Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Gallery, the Asian Civilisations Museum, SAM, free shows at the Esplanade, Kampong Glam, Little India, Chinatown, free guided tours, nature reserves, etc. To go back to your original question: is it a good travel plan for you and your cousins?

You’re very insightful and correct in all your conclusions! This personally resonates so much with me., and in regards to my daughter, also 33!

When she was considering who to invite to her wedding and who would really make the long trip to India, the list was a short one. She realized over the last decade she has let practically all her USA relationships fade. That includes 90% of family and relatives who, with the clarity of distance, she saw were a major source of toxicity in her life. She was able to rekindle a few long lost friendships that needed a fresh, more adult understanding of life to enjoy each other again, and also found that it was ok to quit trying to salvage things with some others. Being able to be with yourself is so important. Unless you live on a submarine, most of us lead singular lives after exiting school. Coworkers are just that. Coworkers. The once popular happy hour meet ups after work or team building events to know your cubicle mate better are out of fashion, post pandemic, we still embrace living a more inward, homebody life and being far from a quick drive to visit at the kitchen table over coffee has resulted in real challenges making new, deep and lasting friendships. As we age, our core circle grows smaller but if lucky, each face is one we cherish, not simply know as an acquaintance.

Keeping a tax residency in Georgia does not stop you paying taxes in other countries. The tax treaties is there to make you decide whether you belong to one or another but it never works like that. You are not a billion dollar corporation that worths to meet up and discuss lol. Tax people do not have time for dealing with you specially there is an international cooperation needed. What really happens is that both governments (or more) can declare you as tax resident in their countries. If there is a tax treaty between these countries, what they normally do is deduct the tax you paid to the other country. If you somehow become a tax resident in one country that charges 10% of income. You paid 1% to Georgia, they will probably ask you to pay 9% difference to the country you became the tax resident. Moreover, each country you go is different. Let say, you went to Estonia and stayed there more than 183 days. What Estonia mostly care about the tax resident is just 183 days. You will be the tax resident there no matter what. But, in Canada being in Canada more than 183 days will not really trigger you as a tax resident (unless you come with the work visa that you require to get the tax number and stuff. If you are there for a holiday, probably they don’t really care even if there are deemed tax resident category). Because for them it is more like establishing a ‘home’. Meaning you have a car, houses, friends and more than they think you live in Canada. So, if you have that and leave Canada even for a year, they will still consider you as a tax resident. Why would a country cares? Either you have a tax number, staying in a country longer than supposed to, or you have a tax number. Each country prioritizes differently but most governments do not really care until you bring more than $10,000. Because you have to provide the source of cash. Or, you are a public figure that known to have a ton of money and somehow just staying in their countries long enough to get their attention. Or, someone, who hate you, report you lol. Mostly, this is the case when authorities go after you. —— You can either keep the Georgian tax residency but it won’t stop you becoming a tax resident in other countries. And also won’t stop you from paying the difference. The only thing is that if you don’t become a tax resident anywhere, you are more likely to be a tax resident at home. But doesn’t mean they will trace you down until ‘you bring your money home’. But yeah. Once you are in the system, I guess you wont be asked much. Regardless of you losing Georgian tax residency means like you have no liability to it. You don’t owe anything to them.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lh84id", "score": 7, "created_date": "2025-06-21T23:04:05+00:00", "author": "chichuchichi", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lh84id/european_nomads_who_settled_in_georgia_is_staying/mz2ay1c/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2776, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": "mz262bl", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:30:53.198609+00:00"}

For most first times, you’ll just have to bite the bullet and go for it. That goes for you going, and for her handling you going. Her anxiety is something she has to manage, unless you plan on managing her emotions forever. That’s not to say you can’t find ways to help her out. It sounds like you’ve done some amount of homework (planning your route, saving up, etc.). It might be helpful to sit your mom down and hear her out on her anxiety. She says she’s worried about other people; does she not worry about other people in the UK? She wants you to find a group of people (I assume strangers?) before you go; why does she trust those people but not the locals? Then walk through how you did your homework - where exactly are you going and are they popular tourist spots; have you researched safety for solo brown girls (e.g., I am Chinese and will almost always try and look up experiences of other folks who look like me because we experience places differently than white folks); for experiences, are they booked through reputable places (e.g., a popular tour versus an Airbnb experience with no reviews); how much emergency funds you have prepared (if you have enough, maybe show her that you always have enough for a backup option to buy a ticket home if you needed). Maybe also come up with a plan to keep in touch, maybe a text at the end of the day everyday or every other day (or however long you think you’d be comfortable with), or share photos of places you’re at so you can both tell her you’ve arrived safely AND are having a good time. She’s still going to worry because that’s just how it goes sometimes. I’ve not personally been to SE Asia but it’s somewhere I’m eyeing for solo trips, but it might also be worth telling her that you’re not just going off on your own without due diligence. There are places I wouldn’t travel solo as much as I’d like to, and if that’s the case for you, you can tell her that too to show that you’re not just being reckless. You’re young and this is new for both of you, and also she’s your mom, so there’s no way she’s not going to worry, but while you’re not responsible for her feelings you can try your best. If she’s still not on board, that’s unfortunate, but you’ll know you’ve done your best. Source: My (very Chinese, despite us immigrating to Canada, so similar boat here) parents threw a raging fit when I told them I plan to solo travel. To this day (I’m 30F), the first thing they ask when I say I’m going somewhere is “are you going with anyone”.

You're split of days per city seems perfectly reasonable to me. In Dresden I would highly recommend visiting the famous Green Vault, which has the largest treasure collection in Europe. The Frauenkirche and Zwinger palace are also well worth visiting. For the day trip to Saxon Switzerland, I would recommend taking a paddle steamer, perhaps on the way back. I did that and it was very enjoyable [ For Berlin, the Olympic Stadium is definitely worth visiting. I would also recommend the Reichstag (advance booking required), Topography of Terror and the Museum Island (unfortunately the Pergamon Museum is closed). A day trip to Potsdam, just outside Berlin, to visit the Sanssouci palace and gardens is a good idea since you have a decent amount of time in Berlin. For public transport in Germany, the Deutschlandticket makes the most sense. It costs €58 and is valid for one calendar month. It's valid on virtually all public transport except for IC, ICE and EC trains (which you'll most likely be taking from Dresden to Berlin - book these in advance for the cheapest fares). I think spending 8 days in Germany would easily justify buying it. It also saves all the hassle of purchasing individual tickets. It's a subscription ticket but you can just cancel it immediately. This is one of the easier places to buy it [ Use [ or the DB Navigator app for booking train tickets or planning public transport journeys in Germany. City transport like trams and buses also appear in the journey planner. I don't stay in hostels so can't offer any advice there.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lh02dx", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-21T17:53:19+00:00", "author": "vg31irl", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lh02dx/solo_travel_questions_about_prague_dresde_and/mz0rkc0/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1644, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:32:02.155253+00:00"}

They stated they were lining up from the middle. Guy even had the audacity to say “me first”. (but quite obvious they cut line la)~_ Edit #1: For the first 10 seconds, I was told by 2 people that the person said that the couple insisted (though aggressively) that the uncle (or aunty because the Chinese word for “he”and “she” sounds the same) was first, and they told it to the cashier. This was followed by “I said He first” which I may have mistook as “Me first”. The old man was still annoyed and ask them to line up properly. I re-listen the clip and I’m still not sure. They could be right, the accent is very thick and I may be mistaken. Personal Thoughts: only reason why I made the first initial translation is because it sounded to me like that, but regardless if the couple insisted that didn’t cut line, why are they so aggressive to let the man “be first”, and why the uncle so angry? 10-20s: Uncle telling them eh line up properly la, you don’t even line up what you talking. Uncle told the couple they they were informed to line up properly, don’t just cut wherever you want. Aunty (lady wearing the hijab spoke in Chinese, or at least I think it’s her) also said at the start “eh you all Chinese people shouldn’t act like this”. 20-25s: Couple clearly getting angry, so is uncle. Uncle tell them you never in line up properly what are you talking about, couple then said stop talking nonsense. 26s-35s: I think the uncle said why you go take my photo? I just ask you to queue up properly what is wrong with you? China guy said aren’t you the one that want to fight? Edit #2: I was discussing with two users, at first we both thought we misheard, but there is a chance the Chinese guy said ”要警察啊，你肉骨茶要吗” which literally translate to “you want police, or you want to eat Bak Kut Teh” which is fucking hilarious. Okay the Chinese dude spit a funny bar there 36-45s: uncle clearly annoyed because China couple are disrespecting him. Uncle then shout at them you want to fight go out and fight la. Young guy then reply you dare or not? Uncle also call them you China people all one kind. Couple weren’t happy 46s+: Young guy was like “you scold China people!? You scold China people? YOU SCOLD CHINA PEOPLE? How about you come and fight China people and we see?” Uncle then go like “come out and fight, come out la!” China guy then went like “I come out!” They then proceed to kiss 💃🕺 Obviously this is not an accurate translation but it pretty much summarises the event.

I hope you get a lawyer and proceed further legally if you can find it within you to do so. This is because personally I feel letting that asshole walk away from this just by paying rent is absolute bullshit and whoever suggested that should lose his job for it. What he did is very wrong and he should be facing the consequences. I don’t understand how anyone could even suggest paying your rent is sufficient punishment. I’m saying this because I know people who have been sexually assaulted. Unfortunately they did not report them. What came of it was them repeatedly try to assault other girls because they didn’t face any consequences. They are animals who don’t have a shred of humanity and all sexual assaulters, from what I’ve seen, act the same way regardless of how they apologize. That being said, the final decision is completely up to you on whether to continue legal proceedings or not. There is absolutely nothing wrong if you don’t want to and just want to put this traumatic incident behind you. But if you can find it in you to give this asshole what he deserves for what he did to you, the many other victims of assault who didn’t get justice will be thankful.

You can't put yourself into a linguistic ghetto and then complain about being in the said ghetto. Then further down, another said that the local Chinese are \"smarter\" because they will concentrate on learning English, which is ***soooooo*** much \"better\" than BM anyway. Of course, why the oh-so-intellectual people there couldn't learn BM alongside English while these PRC can would be an exercise left to the reader 😏 And of course there's a smattering of \"well these PRC will be infiltrating us\", which is just tinfoil-y. Me, I just think it's admirable that these guys are making an effort to learn BM. I don't know if they're \"Chinese spies\" (lol) or not, but I admire worthwhile effort.

The best part is that they know how to enjoy the beauty, every restaurant/cafe/bar has al fresco seating, I don’t think I had a single meal sitting indoors. The weather was stunning, I expected to be burning, but it was the most pleasant weather. A sundress during the day and a light jacket in the evening, that’s what dreams are made of. The food is so incredible, it’s hard to stop eating. I tried every street taco stand and lathered my tacos in the spicy sauces and fresh guac because I figured a tummy ache would be worth it (and my stomach was completely fine). I ate fresh mangos covered in chamoy and tajin everyday and ended the day with a margarita or an aperol spritz. And finally, THE PEOPLE. Everyone is so lovely, every stranger smiles at you, every shop keeper would kindly help me when I mispronounced a word or needed to turn to google translate.

{"id": "mx5pjn6", "title": "Comment on: that weird little moment when solo travel makes you feel insanely alive...", "content": "This wasn't during a solo trip, but it was something i experienced all alone while my wife had gone elsewhere (hotel maybe). We had just finished having coffee at this little café which was actually just a home serving coffee on its front porch, sitting on tiny rickety sidewalk-level chairs, watching local life happen around. Wife wanted to walk back right away but i was enjoying the vibe so much, i told her I'd stay a bit longer and bike back to the hotel. When i decided to leave, I asked the café girl if there was a toilet i could use. She said yes and gestured to follow her. She led me into her house, which, as i saw was common in Hoi An, was very narrow and very long, so we walked through the house, past the living room where there was this man sleeping on a mattress on the floor (i speculate that he was a fisherman and works from the wee hours of morning until sunrise), all the way to the back, where there was the kitchen and, right after it, the tiny bathroom, which was just the toilet and the shower. (Everything, and everywhere, in this home was squeaky clean, putting to shame many western homes I've seen in my life) I peed and flushed and exited towards the kitchen sink to wash my hands. Only there was no water coming from the sink, so i started looking around, fidgeting the faucet to see if there was a trick to it. The girl was nearby and saw me and quickly came to help. She also fidgeted, and when it was clear there simply was no running water at that time, she fetched a little bucket and got some water from a large tub, and gestured for me to wash my hands while she poured water from the bucket. I come from a developing country which has had (still has) its water supply issues, so i am familiar with this method. I don't know if it was this, or the girl's very casual friendliness and helpfulness, or both, or something else... But this whole exchange and experience felt very \"real\" and \"safe\" and \"comforting\" to me, despite being utterly unexpected and so different from most of what I've experienced when travelling. After this, the older woman (probably the girl's mother) fetched my bike for me, and we had a bit of small talk... The usual: where are you from, did you enjoy the coffee, etc. And I've had this exact same small talk before, but for some reason this one hit different and this time, i really felt food talking with them (I'm an introvert, and somewhat socially awkward). I hate to sound cliché, but this family (the girl, and her mother, running the café out of their home) were so welcoming and warm and friendly, that i was like: \"so this is why westerners fall in love with Vietnam\". And it probably is cliché but here's the thing: all the while, as this was happening, the bathroom scene, the small talk, the guys making shoes on the side porch right behind where the coffee cart was, all of this i was experiencing IN THE MOMENT, meaning i was fully \"in the here and the now\". I knew that my wife was back at the hotel, and somehow having agreed on catching up with each other later, i freed myself to slow myself down and experience this place and moment at my own pace. And as i hopped on the bike i felt like i was sunshining from the inside out, and i rode it slowly amidst the traffic, not nervous at all despite having never ridden a bike in the street amidst traffic before, and me being quite a safety paranoid... I felt, as i rode, fully embodied, fully present, and fully happy. It was a glimmer, and one of the highlights of the trip for me. so even if not a solo trip per se, there are solo moments like these, totally unexpected and unassuming, that can make your whole trip shine.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l7y3dx", "score": 64, "created_date": "2025-06-11T06:43:36+00:00", "author": "ichthyomusa", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l7y3dx/that_weird_little_moment_when_solo_travel_makes/mx5pjn6/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 3660, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:33:57.540594+00:00"}

My vehicle needed some unexpected repairs when I drove from Perth to Adelaide, so I decided to stick around the city and found a job to help pay for the repairs. I met two ladies (Scottish and Finnish) who I became fast friends with due to their wonderful personalities. Once my car was fixed, us three traveled together for the next four months. We headed north towards Darwin, then made our way east towards Townsville, then around the coast towards Sydney. During our travels, I made moves towards the Scottish lady, but she wasn't interested. Turned out that she was a closeted lesbian, which I did have an inkling of but wasn't too sure. I knew the Finnish lady was bisexual from a previous conversation we had when back when we were still in Adelaide. At some point during our travels, the girls fell in love with one another. Although I inevitably became the third wheel, I didn't mind as I helped two people find and express love truthfully without fear of being judged. They both lived together in Scotland for a number of years. They sadly broke up last year, but they remain good friends. I'm still friends with both of them today, and I'm actually planning a trip with the Scottish lady to travel the Netherlands this summer. Hopefully I'll get to travel Finland next year to meet my other friend. I definitely agree that the people you meet make the journey memorable. My suggestion is to let people into your life and let things happen organically. Learn from them and let them change your life for the better.

Turns out, she was exactly right. She is also American but had been living in Bangkok for two years at that point and she was the one who told me how sometimes our American brain takes over in terms of safety, because we are SO USED to being unsafe or being approached by unsafe people.

The guide and everyone else abandoned me but I assumed I wouldn't get stuck. I think they should have had a plywood sign with a hole in it that would tell you whether or not you could fit through it.

While trying something new each trip and learning that every destination has something to offer and experience. The little pops of loneliness occur when you’re on the road, and you’re watching others during your travels wishing sometimes you had someone to share it with, but it’s those moments that make me appreciate the times that I do spend with friends and those moments when you do have a conversation with a stranger. I have also learned that the person responsible for making me happy, is me. I’m no longer afraid to eat alone, laugh out loud at something funny and silly, or just pause in a moment of silence to reflect.

{"id": "mwyn610", "title": "Comment on: Personal Growth in Solo Travel...", "content": "Solo travel has definitely changed me permanently in so many ways. Growing up I was an incredibly shy and insecure kid, I used to cry when strangers talked to me (when I was out and about with my mom) and had a really hard time just talking to people in general. Few months before I turned 19 I did a 6 week trip to Europe and on my second day I mentally switched off everything that held me back, and went to talk to some people to ask them a simple question. They invited me to hang out with them and I credit everything that snowballed from that moment on to them. Till this day they’re still great friends! I started to realise that there are so many incredible, kind and giving people out there and I met so many memorable people on that trip. I was definitely that annoying teenager in hostels just clinging on to cool people but that was part of my journey and I don’t regret it! Was definitely ‘cringe’ at times, but it really made me see the good in humanity. 10 years on, someone who meets me for the first time would describe me as confident, calm and ‘easy to talk to’. Truth is, I’m still really introverted and I’m still a little shy, but I’m aware I don’t come across that way any longer. I’ve also internalized all the kindness and love I’ve received from people I’ve met on the road, and it has given me a huge wealth of kindness and love of my own that I freely give out to everyone I cross paths with now. It has made me more secure in who I am, what I can survive, what I’m able to offer the world and of the power I hold to make people smile just by making them feel seen and understood. My mind has been opened so much by meeting so many different people from different walks of life. I haven’t seen nearly as much as I want to, life gets in the way sometimes, but I will forever hold those moments dear to me, and I’ll forever be thankful to every single beautiful person I’ve met that expanded my heart and mind, and thankful to every single beautiful place that has expanded my soul and gratitude to be alive.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l7hcgp", "score": 17, "created_date": "2025-06-10T04:31:35+00:00", "author": "jasonlampa", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l7hcgp/personal_growth_in_solo_travel/mwyn610/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2034, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:34:40.294378+00:00"}

I will be honest: I didn’t have high expectations considering how incredible Karnak was as well some of the other sites found on the West Bank. Luxor Temple, from the outside, seems like a smaller version of Karnak. However, I would say I was pleasantly surprised! First of all, I appreciate this was the only site open after 5 pm (open till 9 pm!) as well as all the hidden layers found carved in stone here. Alexander the Great as pharaoh is carved here, as well as Christian frescoes painted over the hieroglyphs and an 800 year old mosque built over part of the temple, and still in use. This make Luxor Temple perhaps the oldest continuously used temple in the world - a place where humans have tried to connect to the divine for nearly 4,000 years. Not considering the other sites in ancient Thebes, Luxor is a world-class site and I am glad to have played a very small and insignificant part in its history by visiting it!

It’s is a very cool experience. I think you will run into two issues with this setup: 1) In order to get into the heart of the dune field you have to first get up and over some very tall dunes. You can’t really go straight up though because the soft sand is just too steep to traverse that way. You have to basically cut your own switchback trail. I think it would be really hard to carry that behind you in that way; it’s going to want to slide down the dune sideways as you’re hiking. 2) Let’s say you do manage to get up the dunes pulling this behind you… what about going back down? It’s going to want to slide past you down the dunes. I get what you’re going for but in my experience you are much better off just packing as light as possible to keep your overall weight down so that you don’t sink too much into the dunes as you’re hiking, that’s the biggest issue.

{"id": "mwlqhde", "title": "Comment on: How to pack a 40L bag?...", "content": "I’ve been a guide for over ten years and even worked for a short period for a gear shop. My recommendation on how to pack: Sleep system (or as much as can be accommodated) right down the bottom in a separate dry sack. If your pack has a separate section for the bottom: use that. Place the heaviest items along the bottom closest to the back and then up the midline/spine. Sides for medium weight items (take care the weight is evenly balanced) and lightest items to the rear). Absolutely avoid packing anything outside the pack if you can avoid it. Use the side pockets if you must and if you have a pocket on the rear of the pack use that only for light weight stuff. Space in between main section of pack and brain is where I’d place my wet weather gear so I could access it relatively quickly without diving into my pack. If your pack has a brain only use that for things you may need to access from time to time: I had my powerbank in there if I needed to charge a device while I was walking, wallet, headlamp, sawyer squeeze and back up Katadin water purification tablets, pain medication, small first aid supplies. Pockets on hip belt: snacks, phone, pocket knife, things you’ll potentially use more frequently.

You stuff your sleeping bag in trying to fill out all the space at the bottom, then your clothes go on top of that. Twist the trash bag so it's \"waterproof-ish\". Then your food goes in which can actually go into a bag. The stove goes next to the food. Then finally your tent goes in and you jam that into all the open spaces. If there isn't much room left I would put the toiletries in the top part, but I think you should have room. Now the bladder is tricky. I would recommend getting 1.5L water bottles and sticking them in the side pocket.

You do walk in a lot more often to ppl buried in phones. If you chose places carefully you’ll get more social ones (esp if you go the less shiny, facility-loaded ones) The problem I think lies is because of maps, pre-booking, ride shares, translation apps etc everyone is less engaged in the actual ‘travelling’ — where you’d talk to each other and locals to find your way. Who knows what adventures would ensue! Yes it’s now way way way easier, I totally get that & enjoy that too, but that was part of the fun. The unknown was the adventure. Being dependent on yourself, asking for directions and whoever you met was the challenge and the thrill. I can tell you some crazy stories of places I ended up, but often it was the kindness of strangers that saved the day! The “worst” situations always created the best memories Now anyone with a card and connection can find them themselves virtually anywhere — regardless of their disposition. They are not necessarily the adventurous, outgoing ppl of yesteryear and use phones as their crutch for social anxiety. I still have fun travelling and it’s always going to be different for different generations. But my advice is for much as possible, be present. Of course sometimes you immerse yourself on your device to plan. If you are working remotely, get on that laptop. Don’t forget to Observe and admire. Have empathy.

I'm using my ticket to pass the gate to the platforms area, there's no train on platform 11, but it's a bit early and Spanish trains are known to be late, right? Anyway, 10 minutes till expected departure, and there's no train. There's a high-speed train on a platform 14A in another area though, but it clearly says \"Ciudad Real\" and not \"Villena\". And my train is not supposed to be high-speed anyway. 5 minutes, nothing. 0, nothing. 10 minutes after the expected departure, a beated-up New York subway-style train arrives at platform 11, with clearly no intentions of going anywhere. Caught the train driver, he's not going to Villena and have no idea. High-speed train from platform 14A leaves Well, having no options, I'm going back to the railway station building, where the platform gate guy is making a surprised pikachu face and asking - what happened, your train just left! Yes, turned out that high-speed train to Ciudad Real on platform 14A was indeed my commuter train to Villena on a platform 11 and it's obvious! How fucking come?

{"id": "mweb1zv", "title": "Comment on: Taipei is overrated as a digital nomad destination...", "content": "Taiwanese here. I know I'm biased, but I've also traveled to 30+ countries, some of them as a digital nomad, and currently live in the most diverse city in the world, so I think I can try to give an unbiased answer. I think most people who love Taiwan value mega-city safety and cleanliness. My understanding is that if you are working in a coffee shop in Bangkok, Paris, etc., you cannot just leave your laptop to go to the restroom and have it still be there when it's back. In Taiwan, you can. Another hypothesis for why many expats love Taiwan: they love the politeness and orderliness of Japan but don't like how expensive it is or how cold/superficial/overly rigid Japanese people can be. Taiwanese society is generally more polite/friendly towards strangers (than say, Chinese or Koreans) but still have that East Asian orderliness about it. For long-term stays, Taiwan also has one of the best healthcare in the world, both in terms of affordability and quality. E.g. We have pioneered some cardiology research globally. As a girl, the quality of nail/hair/lash salon treatments in Taiwan are also generally quite high. Housing: yes, most Taiwanese housing are quite ugly from the outside, and many are out of date - as a Taiwanese, it's an embarrassment! However, if you know the history of Taiwan, then it makes more sense. We really need to work on it though! Finally, re: food: I think you just weren't patient/adventurous (food-wise) enough :) Taiwanese *night market* staples that aren't fried: - Oyster omelette - Sausage inside sausage - Bawan meat balls - Vermicelli soup - Grilled squid - Coffin bread (variety of veggies inside) - Sticky rice in bamboo (usually comes with mushroom and meat) - Papaya milk These should be available at most night markets. Again, none of them are fried. Fried oyster mushroom is really popular though - and is healthier than french fries or friend chicken. Re: food diversity, again I think you perhaps weren't looking in the right places. Traditional Taiwanese food is filled with all types vegetable dishes, and is probably one of the most vegan-friendly countries in the world. If you're not vegan, you still benefit from having access to lots of healthy vegatable dishes. If you're looking beyond Taiwanese food, here is a sample of how diverse Taiwanese food can be: Sure, it'll be hard to find good Mexican or Ethiopian food, but I really think the Taiwanese restaurant scene is decently diverse.

Surrounded by gorgeous mountains with hot springs, lakes, rivers, oceans, beaches (that are not filled with trash). Lost of small towns with unique culture and history, ie Jiufen, WuLai, Shenkeng, Keelung, Yilan etc. Green space literally everywhere you go. After 2 days in BKK I feel a desperate need to go see some trees. Pocket parks in Taipei everywhere. Bangkok’s one or two parks are a joke. Also Taipei has a bullet train and reliable commuter train system that connects all around the island. Surfing is better, scuba is better. Smog is better, traffic is better, hiking is better, spa is better, beach is better. The only thing I give Thailand the edge on is food. I love Thai food, but Taiwanese food is amazing and there is plenty of solid Thai food in Taipei, as well as every other cuisine. You just aren’t looking hard enough. The food isn’t even that much of a bonus, Taiwanese food is amazing in its own. Coffee in Taipei is better. We don’t have a burning season. We don’t have tourists and sexpats every 3 feet. You aren’t dealing with scams or sketch people like in Thailand, everyone’s trying to find a way to extract a few more bhat out of you everywhere. Less beggars and scams in general. We have a subway line from the airport. Everytime I land in BkK it’s just immediately swarmed with scammers and sketch taxis. Taiwan does not have this culture of scamming people like Thailand does at all. It’s so refreshing. Honestly there isn’t much about Bangkok I like more that Taiwan. I like hiking, hot springs, diving, nature, walking around parks. The feeling of not being surrounded by nothing but concrete. Biking which is nearly impossible with the traffic in BKK. Imo life is better in Taipei in nearly every conceivable way. I don’t smoke weed or fuck prostitutes or like being surrounded by the type of tourists and foreigners that do. I love that there are relatively few foreigners and can go out and speak mandarin everyday and people are quiet and polite on the subway and organized", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l4xlwk", "score": 36, "created_date": "2025-06-06T21:52:05+00:00", "author": "imaginaryResources", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1l4xlwk/taipei_is_overrated_as_a_digital_nomad_destination/mwe3g4e/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2059, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:36:21.216732+00:00"}

I’ve been living the digital nomad life for about 12 years now, also 37, and what you said really clicks with me. I’ve always been a pretty solitary person, not antisocial, just someone who’s comfortable on my own. I was 24 when I started doing this, just out of college, only a couple of years under my belt as a postgrad working professional, with a first love and a bakers dozen of experiences. I didn't decide to nomad because I had some giant need to explore the world. What made the idea of doing it feasible and a possibility was how easy I was able to imagine myself leaving my established friends and family behind. None were shocked by my choice. Martial arts has been my thing. Its what drove me to pursue nomadding. I wanted to train at my friends gyms in Japan and Thailand. I spent my first year going back and forth between there primarily. It’s also how I meet people wherever I go. I always go and stay in places with gyms. At first I might not have known anyone when I landed, but after 12 years I've put down enough roots that I have friends and family, a community in which I cycle through on my journey, As a solitary person, I show up to train, and end up finding people who become friends, invite me out to eat, introduce me to their circle, and I get just enough socializing that suits me. It’s how I’ve stayed grounded. I've met lifelong partners, friends, family doing this. I've started businesses and investments, lost some along the way. I've been living my life on my terms for a long time now. That doesn't always mesh with others but I feel free in how I express myself and choose to live. I think the biggest lessons for me that I didn't know what would make me happy until I gave myself the space to test it. And this lifestyle gave me that space.

{"id": "my2ta96", "title": "Comment on: Malta...", "content": "Having spent a few summers working remotely from Malta, some tips: \\* Give less fucks. There are idiots everywhere here. Try not to get wound up by traffic or people cutting you off in public. \\* Go out before 10am or after 5-6pm, for an hour or two, and enjoy the environment. The beaches are less crowded and it's a nicer temperature to be out anyway. \\* The sea warms up considerably from June onwards. September is ideal - it's starting to cool down but the sea is still warm. \\* Get a box fan if you don't have A/C. \\* Work during the middle of the day (hottest part) if you can. \\* Keep hydrated. \\* Eat ftira for breakfast. Even though it's a lot more expensive than it used to be, you can still get a really nice one for €3,50 or so (example: Xufi in Mosta) which is a big breakfast or a split breakfast and early lunch. \\* Eat pastizzi for snacks. 2 or 3 of them at 50c a pop is good. \\* Find areas that do have trees and go hang out in them. \\* Go and check out the history: the megalithic templates are epic, the cart ruts are mind blowing, the hypogeum is a must if you can find a booking. \\* Go have a beer in the evening at a local bar and chat to some people. \\* Avoid Sliema, St Julians, Gzira. They're modern and whatever but they aren't really Malta. If you're staying in one of those areas, replace \"avoid\" with \"leave\" and go explore other places. \\* Go to Gozo. Rent a place there for a few days. Enjoy the quieter pace of life.

Leaders in Singapore made tough but forward-thinking decisions that prioritized good governance, economic growth, and social cohesion. It's not simply a matter of race. It is about having leadership with the political will and vision to move beyond racial identities to create effective, inclusive policies.

{"id": "mwkwa2u", "title": "Comment on: Singapore Malays and Malaysia Malay share their experiences in their own Countries...", "content": "Millennial Chinese Malaysian who used to work in Singapore here. With excellent command of Bahasa Melayu, it was easy to make friends with the Malay Singaporeans especially the older generation. I had a wonderful time there. I give the benefit of doubt, perhaps the editors cut the video and gave the wrong context. I’d like to clarify: 1. Primary and Secondary Education in Malaysia is NOT FREE but heavily subsidised for all citizens regardless of race. Since when is it free for anyone? Even the Malays pay the same annual fee as far as I can remember during my days in the 90’s. It’s about RM100-200 now (it used to be between 50-80 during my days) and the notice is sent by PIBG/PTA. 2. University quota is supposed to have been abolished but in reality, sadly the practice continues. I bumped into my Malay ex-schoolmate in a university and even he expressed how pissed off he was when he found out some of his classmates entered medicine with only MUET Band 2 while he (being among the top students I always remembered) worked so hard for a Band 6! 3. Cheaper price for Malay homes, yes but are very limited, only for specific units and NEVER going to be corner lot. Many Malays if they can help it, actually avoid going for bumi lots because it will be difficult to sell them later due to restrictions. Free land to build homes? If I’m not mistaken it was only one off during Tun Abdul Razak’s time, and it’s targeted. One example is FELDA, which requires those in the program (Peneroka FELDA) to actually work in agriculture. Sorry, no free lunches there. Nowadays? I haven’t heard of Malays being given free land for the longest time. Try to get grant for agriculture also damn hard unless you’re willing to offer huge sums of ahem ahem (under table moolah) to some low level pegawai. 4. Chinese and Indians try to avoid government service mainly because we want faster salary and career growth and flexibility, instead of being restricted to one single field for the rest of your life. Yes the perception of racial preference is still there but it’s not the main factor. As a son to 2 retired Chinese teachers who are earning at the top of the service and command respect in the community including the Malay kampung where she taught, “discrimination” is not really a thing. And no, you don’t need to be brilliant to enter government sector. Matching your peers is good enough. 5. Royalty of course cannot be Chinese or Indian. Our ancestors immigrated here (I think she got mixed up, she wanted to refer to the Prime Minister job instead). The rulers are Malays and so will the descendants that eventually take over. Will the British royalty be Chinese or Indian one day despite their growing influence and wealth there? Did the Chinese had an emperor who was not Chinese at one point in history? Haiyo. 🤦🏻‍♂️ 6. Ok lah for Singapore, in terms of national policies, there are programmes and laws to help protect the minorities. A few Chinese locals have also been prosecuted and fined for ridiculing the Malays there (void deck weddings, Chinese student’s racial remarks on the Malays in 2012 iirc, and recently Ngee Ann Polytechnic sacked a lecturer Mr Tan Boon Lee for racial remarks). The issue is just that many local private businesses indirectly practice discrimination by asking for mandarin language competency suddenly even when it’s not listed in the job description or the company does not do business with China. Me, with near zero command of Chinese (banana here) was never asked that question (nor was I tested) in job interviews in SG. Another rant among the Malay Singaporeans is that Singapore is reluctant to give sensitive military positions to the Malays, which is actually reasonable if you know why. Ref: Lastly, as a Chinese, when I went to Singapore, I finally understood what it feels like to be the majority. The sense of entitlement is real. And yes, my Malay Singaporean friends can actually understand how we Chinese Malaysians feel in Malaysia because they can somewhat relate.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l5bb6e", "score": 23, "created_date": "2025-06-08T00:44:28+00:00", "author": "SouthernCrow5442", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1l5bb6e/singapore_malays_and_malaysia_malay_share_their/mwkwa2u/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 4019, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:36:42.335285+00:00"}

{"id": "mvkct90", "title": "Comment on: The untold story of Singapore’s exit from Malaysia...", "content": "This is what I gather from the situation, with context of the secret negotiations: At the very beginning Singapore wanted to be part of Malaysia. Evidently, Singapore has major geographical problems, anyone at the time expected Singapore becoming part of Malaysia. Even Malayans supported the idea. Negotiations of integration with Singapore and North Borneo bore fruit, resulting in Malaysia. It wasn't all smooth but at the time, they figured the details could've been furnished later on with civil \"top down\" negotiations. But when they got into that process, Singapore and Malaya got into some disputes, mainly economic policy. Then, around the same time, racial demographic issues began cropping up and it got real ugly. The two elements came together and things started going out of hand as the PAP and UMNO began openly antagonizing one another during election season. Young UMNO ultranationalists began agitating the public, sending racial issues into overdrive. From what I can understand, the rhetoric called for the PAP to be kept out of Malayan politics and acceptance of federal economic demands. PAP basically refused and that turned into a mess of people asking for Singapore's expulsion or subjugation. Tunku and LKY were under immense pressure. Tunku was in a particularly bad position as the younger UMNO ultras were steadily gaining influence. Tunku had to give them something they wanted whilst not permanently damaging relations with Singapore, or worse, ruling with an iron fist. LKY was in a similar situation. The federal economic measures were considered unacceptable by Singaporeans and there was no way for them to stay in the federation without acquiescing to it. Racial threats had also convinced many that there was no way unity was possible. Both sides decided to negotiate a divorce, but these proceedings were kept secret to ensure full control over the narrative and prevent dissenters within the federal government from seizing control and ruling via the ISA. The narrative was that Malaysia ejected Singapore, which made Tunku look strong to ultranationalists and LKY a victim of a seemingly unilateral divorce. Imho, Tunku and LKY were actually into the union but things got too heated as economic divisions spiralled into racial conflicts that nobody wanted. And the demographic situation was unsolvable aside from division.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l1dkv6", "score": 129, "created_date": "2025-06-02T10:28:57+00:00", "author": "silverking12345", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1l1dkv6/the_untold_story_of_singapores_exit_from_malaysia/mvkct90/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 2362, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:36:45.335928+00:00"}

You can expect JIPS to reach out to you. 2. You lodge a police report against the errant police personnel. This automatically gets forwarded to JIPS. I would do this only if JIPS does not respond within 30 days. 3. If all else fails, and you really want to pursue it further, bring your Sispaa and police report to a lawyer for advice.

{"id": "muk0ode", "title": "Comment on: Should I move back to Malaysia. Advice needed....", "content": "I left Canada after decades there since my early teens and ended up in KL just before the lockdowns. What was supposed to be a 3 week visit has turned out to be a homecoming I wasn't expecting. Although I hadn't lived in Malaysia previously, I've never felt more at home. So I'll try to be as blunt as I can to a fellow countryman. Politically and culturally speaking, I've watched Canada slide downhill for years even as early as 2009. And by 2014, everything I saw going sideways, did, and I planned my exit accordingly. Even since I've left, the cost of living and crime rates are up significantly and the quality of life has diminished considerably. Canada is still a fantastic country to live in if you're making 6 figures and up after taxes. So if your career or skillsets points you in that trajectory, you may still have something to look forward to. Anything less however, and it's going to be a day to day grind for you until you retire. Yes, there's free healthcare (if and when they can see you) and an amazing country to explore coast to coast. Hockey is a better sport to enjoy and cultural diversity is celebrated, although it doesn't void the fact that racism and being a minority will still affect you. Most of my friends back home have visited KL and this region and are slowly planning their exit as well. 2 have already moved to SEA, 2 more are moving in the next year, and at least another 4-5 are planning to over the next few years. The exodus is real. Even for you, if family and quality of life are important to you, Malaysia might be a better option. Time with aging parents is everyone's enemy. The only caveat I would add is that you figure out how to translate your skillsets into paying you CAD, USD, EURO, BTC etc. But even in the worst case scenario, surviving in Malaysia is infinitely easier than surviving in Canada.

{"id": "mulmpcg", "title": "Comment on: Should I move back to Malaysia. Advice needed....", "content": "Malaysian here in New Zealand. I understand where you are coming from as I have experienced this myself, but honestly, it sounds more like homesickness than anything else. Sounds cliche, but no matter how \"introvert\" people tend to claim, we as humans all need a social life. We want to \"belong\" to a tribe. Pick up hobbies, sports, or causes where you have the chance to meet people and make connections. I once lived in a small town with only around 8000 people in the middle of the South Island for a year. The nearest \"big city\" was Dunedin which was 2h 30m away so this is way smaller than Winnipeg. Admittedly I have my girlfriend & Malaysian working holiday friends, but I also made a real effort to social activities like running and hiking clubs, book clubs, hobby workshops, talk groups, book clubs, anything. I also made a concious effort to befriend my colleagues outside of work, and connect with the Malaysian group which hosts events in the nearby bigger town. That group was very tight knit and welcoming. I have moved to Auckland. It's the biggest city in NZ, but still quite small by global standards (it's only slightly bigger than Calgary). But ever since that small town, I have made it a point to put myself out there, talk to people, and be social. I work in automotive retail, and over time, even some of my customers have even become good friends. I go to an urbanists' meetup which is a networking opportunity. Don't know how social your workplace is but your company/organisation will probably have work lunches etc. Put yourself out there and befriend work colleagues. Small talk is essential in most of the Anglosphere. If that's your thing, joining a religious group can help too. I go to church, but it could be anything that aligns with your beliefs. Canada is just as multicultural as New Zealand, so you will likely find a space that suits you. The gym is good for your health, but it is not the most social place in my experience. You might want to join a more interactive setting like a kickboxing gym or group fitness classes, or yoga/pilates especially if you're female. I also volunteer with an organisation that does anti AIDS and STI awareness work when I have time. And I play futsal regularly with a bunch of mostly Malaysians. It could be any sport, so long as its social. Staying in touch with loved ones overseas is easier than ever. With video calls, you are only a few taps away. Time differences can be tricky, but it just takes some effort. I know some immigrants who call home every single day. There is even a running joke about Indian Uber drivers always being on the phone with their wives in India. You do not have to go that far, but even a weekly call can go a long way. I'm not sure if you have an SO but it would be great to do that too. A good SO goes a long way. Of course being single is better than a toxic relationship, but a good relationship is way better than being single. This was my experience. You are probably in a better position than I was. I was born, raised, and schooled in the exact same neighbourhood in KL. Even in uni I stayed home. Most of my friends were from school. From what you have written, it sounds like you do not have much of a social circle outside your family. That can be tough, but it also means you have a blank slate to build your own community.

That's super great. But you're right - realistically that might he tough with the current rules, but let's see how far you can get with it, considering you have a PR and that. Back to your predicament. Should you go back? Yes and no. Look, there's nothing like family, and sounds like you have a good one too since you want to be close to them. I get the homesickness and loneliness - especially living in a foreign land far away, and one that comes with brutal winter too.

Start with this - don't jump the gun, yet. With your current salary you'll need to find a place that pays RM13K net, so a gross of close to RM17-18k - with 3 YoE realistically you're not getting that - probably RM4-5k. Tops. So if you want to go back, see if the financials make sense, you'll probably be living with your parents again so not an issue in saving up etc. Also what's your financial goal? Save up in general? Buy a house? Those will determine how much money you \"want\". Otherwise with a 4k salary it will be a longg slog to save for say - a house. Additionally see what's the going market rate for your field and decide from there. Best to stay at the moment, and push ahead with your dreams to bring them here. Along the way you'll gather experience - and if you really want to come back, further down the road you can, with the experience you have and command a higher salary.

Choose what is most important to you in this season of life. You will have to make sacrifices either way, so depends what is important to you to have. I have considered what life would be like if I moved back, but wasn’t ready to compromise on things like poorer work life balance, lower pay (things in KL aren’t affordable anymore!), subsequently inability to save or invest, and poorer job prospects (my career is very under appreciated in Msia). On top of that, I’d have more challenging paperwork to deal with as I have a spouse and child here who are not Malaysian. I would certainly move if US tries to invade Canada but otherwise I’m staying put. Malaysia would always be home to me though.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwr6ks", "score": 4, "created_date": "2025-05-27T23:01:36+00:00", "author": "HaworthiaRYou", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1kwr6ks/should_i_move_back_to_malaysia_advice_needed/mulphcw/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 961, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:36:56.059041+00:00"}

Singapore --> flew to Langkawi --> combo ferry x grab to station x commuter train x grab to hotel (sounds like a lot but was cheap and actually very comfortable/straightforward) to Penang --> high speed rail to KL --> flight back to Singapore. My take was KL was really fun to explore and worth spending time in. We did a number of tours to learn more about the history, spent time wandering Chinatown, etc. We ran out of time to do everything there because things are a bit spread out and it can take a while with traffic to get to different parts of the city. I was talked out of Cameroon highlands and Malacca for the same reasons (if you've been, I also found Hoi An too touristy so depends on what you like). I don't regret spending more time in KL. Personally, I would skip Malacca and spend more time in KL, and if you can afford to in Singapore (those hotel prices are no joke...at least for my budget!). There was a whole half of the island/hiking/eco walks we just ran out of time for. The only other thing I would do if I had more time was the Perhentian islands on the east coast...if you're looking for great snorkeling/swimming this could be a swap out but you'd need to fly in.

Near the Thai Malay border on the Thai side there’s a few provinces that are kinda dangerous not recommended for travel, it’s fine tho if u travel near the west coast across the Thai Malay border. The only other dodgy area is the islands off north east Borneo have a kidnapping risk that area is not recommended. Safety wise the scams are pretty similar to like every other country, some random ones, taxi/ tuktuk drivers telling u a place is closed when it’s not and taking u to a different place for a lot of money, scams with renting equipment and being told u caused damage when u didn’t, just stuff being overpriced, like taxis use grab or negotiate the price. Other risks are food safety so be careful with what you eat and also the traffic can be quite crazy be careful 4. U will struggle like a lot just in terms of labelling of allergens in places not being very common. Google to death 10 gluten free restaurants for every destination u end up in or cook in ur accommodation. Relying on random people with cards saying you have an allergy to not put wheat in the food would be quite risky you would probably get ill at least once but u can try that 7. U don’t need any vaccinations as just a standard tourist wandering round the regular tourist route just bug spray and also endless suncream 11. There isn’t a month worth of things to do in Cambodia but u can also go to Laos which is a very interesting country, or just book a flight outside of south east Asia if u feel like it to Hong Kong China Taiwan depends what ur nationality allows easily passport wise tbh", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lfm2fw", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-19T22:56:19+00:00", "author": "turtledude100", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lfm2fw/tips_on_traveling_to_asia_vietnam_thailand/mypraqt/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1627, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:09.502639+00:00"}

{"id": "mxc0nna", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia – advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "Malaysian here, hope you find these answers helpful. 1. Is the Sabah region safe? Generally safe. You'll find some travel advisories regarding the east coast of Sabah which used to be targeted for pirate kidnappings. Authorities have kept it under control recently but something to keep in mind. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5–7 days? Lots to do in Sabah such as the Sepilok Orangutan reserve, Kota Kinabalu town, Mabul & Sipadan islands for diving, Mount Kinabalu for hiking. The problem is transportation between them which I'll get to later. 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? It seems you are going for a nature themed trip which will generally be more authentic than going to urban areas. 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? It is difficult to get around the areas of your interest, East Peninsula and especially Sabah. There are no trains or public transport. Roads are very bad in Sabah. Your best bet would be buses but those are operated by private companies and you'll want to vet through carefully to make sure they are legit. Driving or motorbike on your own at your own risk, as mentioned the roads are bad. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? I would suggest you consider Sarawak. It is more developed than Sabah but also offers a lot in terms of nature, though mostly forest based vs island based. Would be much easier to arrange transport around Sarawak. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Redang Island is a boat ride from Perhentian. Tioman is further but also noteworthy. On the mainland there are the towns of Kuala Terengganu and Kuantan. Lake Kenyir also for an inland forest reserve. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? For just a day, I'd recommend staying near the airport. Not much to do in just a day in KL and it is quite a distance from the airport. The airport train is convenient though expensive, might want to see if you feel it is worthwhile to stay in the city based on that.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9e0es", "score": 5, "created_date": "2025-06-12T05:34:27+00:00", "author": "FireTempest", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l9e0es/malaysia_advice_on_borneo_and_east_coast/mxc0nna/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 2130, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:14.849110+00:00"}

But it's relatively easy to get around with buses and trains that takes you from north to south of Malaysia. * Malacca: Cultural sights. They do have a famous night market (Friday to Sunday only) where you get to take in the local sights, smells, and food. * Penang: Foodie haven. * Kuantan: Beaches and Nature (Waterfalls) are beautiful. * Cameron Highlands: Enjoy the colder weather. There are farms like Strawberries and Tea plantations if you are into that sort of thing. Be warned though - the travel there can be quite risky depending on the weather. * Genting Highlands: Casinos and Theme Park. Can also enjoy the colder weather. * Ipoh: In my opinion, quite similar to Malacca in terms of vibes. The food is also good. * Sabah & Perhentian would require a flight. Cheaper flights can be found, but I would suggest at least a 4-day trip if you are planning on going to those states. For jet-skiing or parasailing, I would suggest Langkawi Island, if that is not feasible during this trip, then Penang or Port Dickson might be a closer option.

{"id": "mvuz0ug", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia, 3 weeks, tips and itinerary...", "content": "I was just there in March. I really loved Borneo and wish I allocated more time. Did not care for Taman Negara. Liked the Cameron Highlands a lot (just don't go on the weekends). Taman Negara was perhaps the biggest disappointment. I had 2 nights there, and by the morning after the first, I was plotting how I could cut out early to the next destination. Here's the thing about Taman Negara... the canopy walk has been closed for a while now, and will probably remain that way for a while. Other than that, a lot of the treks are similar, and you won't see much wildlife. The night tour was OK, but this is definitely not off the beaten path. If you want to leave the crowds behind, you have to commit yourself to a guided (i.e., pricey), uncomfortable, leach-filled, overnight trek. Cameron Highlands pleasantly surprised me. Yes, it's built up. Yes, it's touristy. But the scenery is spectacular, and there are multiple trekking opportunities. Keep in mind, the estimated times you see are grossly underestimated. In spite of the fact that development is encroaching on the trails, some of them are true jungle treks -muddy, difficult, and extremely steep (as in, more of a climb than a trek). Borneo is where you can really leave the crowds behind, and find those clean seas and crowd-free jungle treks where you can actually see animals. Mind you, I barely scratched the surface. But I'll say this, even a day trip to Bako National Park is extremely worth-while, where you'll have an excellent chance to see bearded pigs, proboscis monkeys, and of course spectacular scenery. Overnight is even better. I did Mt. Kinabalu, including the highest via ferrata in the world, and that was without a doubt one of the highlights (if not the highlight) of the trip. But very expensive. Did not even get to other spectacular scenery like Gunung Mulu NP. Kuching is a great town to base yourself in Borneo. Nearby you'll have access to national parks, a sanctuary of semi-wild orangutans, several local villages, and a delightful waterfront that serves as a promenade for locals. I haven't mentioned the cities so much, because you seem to not like cities as much. But I really liked the canopy walk on Penang Hill. Not crowded at all when I went, but it was a weekday on Ramadan, so YMMV.

{"id": "mxby7nc", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia – advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "I spent almost all of my two-week Malaysia trip in Borneo! The Sabah travel advisories mostly focus on specific islands off the east coast of Sabah where there have been some security incidents in the past targeting tourists. So if in doubt you could avoid those islands. The Sabah portion of my trip was spent in Sandakan (as a base for a tour of Kinabatangan River area) and Kota Kinabalu (as a stopover before heading to Mulu National Park). Sandakan and KK are kind of odd cities in and of themselves but they don't feel particularly touristy, at least not the areas I stayed in. For seeing the Kinabatangan River area (and/or nearby-ish Danum Valley) you pretty much need to join a guided tour group since these areas are somewhat remote/wild, and the guides can find the wildlife. I saw three wild orangutans! Getting around in Borneo can be a bit impractical. On a tight schedule domestic flights unfortunately are the most reasonable option, or sometimes the *only* option. From Kota Kinabalu you could hike Mount Kinabalu if you want to. I'd have done that if I had more time. It sounds kinda intense though and is an overnight commitment. But if you like hiking it sounds probably worth it! I think there are some islands near-ish KK that you could visit and they're I think pretty far from any of the islands covered under some of the eastern Sabah travel advisories. If you add anything else to a Borneo itinerary, it might be worth considering Mulu National Park - it's more conventionally \"touristy\" in some ways but the massive caves there are unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. Deer Cave is, I think by most measures, the largest cave in the world. I stayed a night in KL after arriving and was glad I did. For a major city I thought it had a kind of relaxing \"vibe\" and great food, and I was grateful to not need to immediately get on another plane after arriving in the country.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9dzgl", "score": 11, "created_date": "2025-06-12T05:13:26+00:00", "author": "WalkingEars", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l9dzgl/malaysia_advice_on_borneo_and_east_coast/mxby7nc/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1902, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:33.424157+00:00"}
{"id": "mxgd31i", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia – advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "1. Is the Sabah region safe? There are some tourist areas within areas with poorer folk, but like any other tourist place just exercise caution with beggars and pickpockets. But it is generally safe. If you aare referring to terrorist activities, this was around 10 years ago and there hasn't been tourist related threats since. Although you'll still see some armed personnel on beaches and islands here and there. But overall it's generally safe for tourists. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5–7 days? From Kota Kinabalu, go to Mt Kinabalu. It is incredibly expensive to do the 2D1N climb up due to quotas but you can still do a day trip hike around the base of the mountain from Kota Kinabalu. Alternatively you can also stay in the nearby Kundasang area (beautiful views) but it is difficult to get around without a car. From there you have some alternatives. Alternative 1 - Fly or take the bus to Sandakan. Do the 3D/2N or 4D/3N Kinabatangan cruise + Sepilok orang utan centre. Sightings of wildlife at Kinabatangan are not guaranteed so most people do 3D2N but you can still absolutely do a 2D1N trip. Then you can try to squeeze in the second alternative if you'd like. Alternative 2 - Fly or take the bus to Tawau. Then take the van to Semporna. Do the 3D2N or 4D3N island hopping hikes and dives. The main attraction is Sipadan but just like Mt Kinabalu, it is also expensive to do it due to quotas. However there are many other islands and dive spots around that are just as gorgeous. You can fly from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. 3. it too touristy or still authentic? Yes there are lots of tourists especially Chinese, Japanese and Koreans. But it's popular because it's gorgeous (and is a known vacation spot for East Asian celebrities). 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? Grab is a ride hailing app that is used everywhere. Taxis are overpriced if you try to haggle in person but they are also on Grab and prices are more transparent there. Do not attempt to haggle with a Malaysian taxi driver, they can get aggressive. Bike and car rentals are available everywhere. There are no motorbike taxis in Malaysia. For buses, download the Easybook or Redbus app. They are mostly used in Malaysia and prices are the same as in the bus stations unlike 12goasia. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? If you have just 1 week, stick to Sabah. If you have 2 weeks, you can do Sarawak as well. If you have 3-4 weeks, then you can consider Kalimantan. I've backpacked the entire island by land except when entering Brunei, feel free to ask me anything. You might want to check out the relevant subreddits r/Sarawak and r/Sabah. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Pulau Tioman and Pulau Redang are also popular but you won't have time to fit this in your current itinerary. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? If you've never been, KL is a cool place to check out for the night, especially if you love skyscrapers. KLCC Twin towers have a nice park (and are an icon of Malaysia) and the TRX is a magnificent tower. The food in Kuala Lumpur is also underrated compared to neighbouring capital cities. If you're not a fan of big cities and malls, definitely skip.

I had to stay in one in both directions when I was headed out to scuba dive on the islands, and I made sure I was in my room before dark. It was not comfortable. That said, I found plenty of people at the hostel in exactly the same situation, so had people to go out with, and it wasn’t an issue on the buses at all – I took public transport everywhere with no problem. Reliable and easy. And the tourist areas are very safe. As far as “authentic” – don’t ask me, my first visit to Sarawak was in 1992 and to say that it has changed is a massive understatement.

The only reason why you want to go there is because you want to smoke w all day everyday or be in a community full of foreigners. You will not find local culture there. Cambodia. Unless you really love temples, ankor wat is the best they have to offer. PP is not worth visiting imo. The palace is ok but is way overpriced for what they are charging Singapore. What attracts you to Singapore? Singapore is overpriced and the attractions are not great. I dont even know why people want to go to Singapore other than checking out jewel. I fly through there many times because i like the SIA lounge and jewel. Other than that, i dont even bother to go pass jewel anymore. Some say the Singaporen food is good. I personally disagree. HK food is similar, much better, and better price. Malaysia. KL and penang pretty decent food but so unhealthy. I only fly there to eat durian. There are a lot more good places if you love beaches and nature. Indonesia.

The South Island isn’t known for their beaches or history (most of that is up north). It’s known for its nature, mountains, backpacking, and outdoorsy culture, and you can easily spend 5 weeks just hiking around New Zealand. Vietnam is amazing and totally worth visiting, Taiwan is a bit sleepy, lots of history there and cool to see before anything political happens, but seeing anything worth it in Taiwan required a lot of driving or getting around by train.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1ldq1fp", "score": 5, "created_date": "2025-06-18T05:03:07+00:00", "author": "BlazeRunner738", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ldq1fp/5weeks_in_oceania_asia/myebfiq/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1129, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:40.105304+00:00"}

They're not bad, don't get me wrong, but end of the day both are essentially big cities without standout tourist attractions (like say the monuments in Paris / Rome). If you're in the area and have some extra days or you live in the region, sure, but not really highest priority for the area imo.

To be completely frank, China is a bit more challenging as a travel destination - language barrier aside, the Great Firewall means you likely need to download a couple extra apps so you're ready for it. VPN if you want to access your normal sites (Google sites, etc.), local apps (a local maps and translator app because Google apps won't work, Didi (Uber equivalent), figure out WeChat and WeChat / AliPay for local payments, etc.).

A couple of suggestions. >Mon, Aug 25: Train to Ayutthaya 3 days in Ayutthaya is too much. Honestly, depending on what you are interested in, it can be done as a day trip (it would rushed), I would get there, explore bit, explore night market street, next morning tour the temples and then get back to BKK. >Sun, Sep 7: Fly to Penang Again, 4 days in Penang is too much. Its nice and I have been multiple times, but one suggestion would be cut a day or two and bus to Ipoh (and Cameron Highlands) and then down to KL. Ipoh has a great food scene and Cameron Highlands is a great change of pace. Tea fields are amazing and the Mossy forest will be a good change of pace. >Tue, Sep 16: Fly to Bali If you are planning to visit Borobodur, Prambagan and Bromo and Ijen, I would actually fly to Jakarta and then train to Yogya. From Yogjya to Ijen then ferry over to North Bali and then Ubud down to Kuta and then other islands. Indoenesia is WAY bigger than you think.

It will likely be better weather and going on Sep 16 you will coincide with Australian School/Uni holidays so you will have more Aussies there. Agree with the other post about Ayutthaya. I love Bangkok, but 10 days is too much when you have more to do. Fly from Bangkok to Krabi and do Ao Nang (and probably Khao Sok from here too), Railay Beach, then across to Phi Phi, ending up in Phuket. >Wed, Sep 17 - Thu, Oct 2: Island hop/explore (Borobudur, Mount Bromo, Komodo National Park, etc) Doing Borobudur and Mount Bromo from Bali can be done, but it can be a grind and will take days. Do plenty of research on this. Personally I would stick with Bali and head east to the islands. >I am planning to only book my departure flight and maybe the first regional flight because I want the flexibility to adjust my schedule and leave earlier/stay longer depending on my experience - has anyone had issues with having to show proof of onward travel?

A week in El Nido is a long time. From memory there are 3 (or 4?) day trips from El Nido to do island hopping. There are some nice beaches in the surrounding area, but a week is too long. Do some research on this. Bohol for a week is also a long time. After 4 or 5 nights you would be wanting out. I would research this whole thing more. Others have posted about a trip from Coron to El Nido boat trip that is recommended, if you are in to that. You can also fly direct from El Nido to Boracay (Caticlan). Truly one of the best beaches in the world and while it is full of tourists, walk down the beach to the end of Station 3 and you can have the beach mostly to yourself. From there you can fly to Bohol. Christmas time in the Philippines is a peak travel time, so you will need to book flights and accommodation, but expect tourist places to be overflowing with crowds. You could steal some time from Vientiane as it is just a city and four full days there is not as much fun, compared to VV and Luang Prabang.

A war could break out, a natural disaster could occur, places might become more attractive or less attractive destinations for you for a number of reasons. In terms of finding decent accommodations, checking a few days in advance is usually enough. Also in terms of researching where to go, public transport logistics, etc. And not having everything set in stone beforehand also allows you to change your mind along the way. If you really want to spend time planning, Maybe spend some checking things like seasonal peculiarities in some of those places, such as what time in the year it makes sense to go to Japan (spoiler: it's either spring or autumn), what traditional festivals that you could witness will take place where and when, etc. PS: Some of the places you've mentioned I would include along the most overrated, overcrowded touristic destinations in the world, like Ko Phi Phi for example, or Canggu (in fact, much of Bali).", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l2a0oa", "score": 3, "created_date": "2025-06-03T15:13:42+00:00", "author": "jvjjjvvv", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1l2a0oa/how_do_people_plan_these_things/mvs7cqq/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1062, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:38:01.507142+00:00"}

Thailand is the perfect place to \"learn\" how to travel, then continuing on the Banana Pancake Trail through Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is really easy too. Finishing with Indonesia and Malaysia is very simple and straightforward. You're now ready to move to South Asia and do Sri Lanka and India. By this time you'll be experienced enough to handle your first ambitious country - India - with no problems. Also, India has great flight connections to Europe then onward to Latin America. Small point, it's Col**o**mbia. Lastly regarding your itinerary and choice of countries... It's great that you've done this research and prep. So many first timers come to travel forums and expect everyone to turn in their private Travel Agent and plan everything for them. Kudos to you. You've put together quite an itinerary and it's a fantastic guide/template to start your trip. That said, I think you should be prepared to throw much of your plan into the trash bin. The best thing *by far* about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. 1.) There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... 2.) There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... 3.) And most importantly there will be places you've never even considered that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out... **Bottom line:** Make use of this wonderful opportunity and be open to at least *some* spontaneity. Be prepared to venture away from the usual tourist centres every now and then. And very importantly be prepared to slow down a little and not be so worried/fixated about checking boxes. Good luck.

Digital nomads aren't exactly the most attractive tenants, since they'll be staying in Malaysia for a **maximum** of 12 months, which is what the country's digital nomad visa allows them. After that, they're gone, which means that there needs to be a consistent inflow of digital nomads into Malaysia to make it work. Secondly, the Malaysian government approved only 2,000 digital nomad visas between 2022 and 2024 (out of 4,000 applications). \\[1\\] That implies 1,000 digital nomads a year. You talk about \"taking a building with 200-300 apartments\", suggesting you want to grab 20-30% of Malaysia's entire share of digital nomads. How likely is that, given that digital nomads will likely be spread throughout Malaysia rather than concentrated in Johor state? Thirdly, Forest City is a ghost town targeted at Chinese customers. Sure, there are groceries on site, but it's going to be Chinese-oriented, which isn't going to appeal to every digital nomad. It looks like the nearest supermarkets, like the AEON Mall or Jaya Grocer, are **25km or more** away. That's a hell of a trek just to restock the fridge. There's always Singapore, I suppose, but the idea that one has to **cross an international border** just to get supplies is nuts. \\[1\\] [", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kvwuqs", "score": 58, "created_date": "2025-05-26T15:41:45+00:00", "author": "uml20", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1kvwuqs/how_to_turn_malaysias_100b_ghost_city_into_a/mucwu5j/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1274, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:38:09.300208+00:00"}
