Even with a 4.0 CGPA result. *Some hot courses like medicine, pharmacy, law, and accounting have seen single digit intake with graduates from STPM. *Most notably affected by the intake policies are the non-bumi students, who were mostly unable to enter Matriculation. While non-bumi numbers remain stable in public uni, they are mostly from direct intake, where they pay the full tuition fee rather than the subsidized fees through the UPU system. *So what's the implication? In essence, the non-bumi community has, in effect, disenfranchised from subsidized public higher education in this country. With the expanded matriculation by the government, it's close to impossible for non-bumi students to access affordable higher education.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lian43", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-23T07:56:43+00:00", "author": "imaginelizard", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1lian43/is_the_system_blocking_the_way_to_further/mzakz5l/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1152, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:25:10.454995+00:00"}

If plans didn‚Äôt work out, it didn‚Äôt matter (we never did make it to the zoo lol) because the goal was never really the activity anyway, but enjoying where the day took us. We knew we wanted to try out new breweries because we are a couple of beer snobs, so we found a few of those as well - hoping to visit more, but we found three along our journey and that sufficed. Just walked in, grabbed a flight or two of beers and chilled. Sometimes brought the dogs with us; sometimes we didn‚Äôt. Just let the day flow as it would. Rinsed and repeated the next day.

Took the train from Prague to Kutna Hora specifically to see the 'Bone Church', and got off at the correct stop, around 2:30 p.m. The few other people who got off there disappeared pretty quick, and I looked for a train ticket or tourist information office type place, which I found. It was closed. I stood on the footpath next to a pole, there was a paper stuck on it that looked maybe a bus timetable. But it was wet and a bit torn, and I anyway know no Czech. About 15 minutes later, a woman shows up where I was, and I figured it was the bus stop, after all. She is waiting there, a short woman, pretty, with a tiny dog in her small handbag. I ask her if she speaks Enlighs. \"Little.\" So I ask her if she knows how I can get to this church. \"Bus.\" But she didn't say it like bus, she rhymed it with puss, like Puss in Boots. Took me a bit to get it (my bad totally). Anyway, I had no idea which bus, but she was nice enough to motion me to enter the same bus she was getting into. Not nice enough to point out where I should get off, though. Maybe her stop came before mine and she figured (correctly) that she didn't owe me the full directions anyway. And I had (wrongly) thought that she would tell me anyway. I tried asking a couple of people in the bus but they didn't speak any English. Around then, I spotted a sign of a tourist information office zipping by outside, so I pressed the button to signal the driver that I wanted to get off the next stop. He stopped the bus immediately, turned around and began screaming at me. In Czech, of course, so I have absolutely no clue what he is so mad about. Before I can even decice how I should react, half the bus is screaming at him! One old man is saying something that I assume is meant to be consoling, sympathetic, explanatory, or all three. When we finally reach the next stop, I figured the driver was mad because it was that route's last stop :D I get to the information place finally and am told that I had about 4km too far ahead on the bus. If I wanted to see this church I was keen on, I could take another bus which runs once every 30 minutes. And oh, the church closes to tourists at 5 p.m. It was 4:30 p.m. I alternated between running and waiting at bus stops when I reached them, about half a minute at each. I can walk a dozen km in a day easy, but I was pretty out of breath after running a couple. At 4:50, I almost gave up. And then, at the sight of a church - not that church, a different one - I gave up. I figured I would see any damn church at this point since I have come all the fucking way to this town and all, you know. My heart obviously wasn't in it, so I don't really remember much of it. Got the bus back to the station from there. And then the train back to Prague. The \"high\" point of the day was getting shitfaced with some people I met in the hostel. I was flying out the next day, or else I might have gone again.

Apparently it was out of coolant and the bus was straight out overheated from the weather. It broke down again a couple of stops later, so i got out and just walked to the trainstation which was pretty close now. I tried checking the train app for which trains to take but somehow it didn't work. It wasn't a sim card issue because i have two in my phone and i switched between them. Then google maps gave me a warning that it's switching to dark mode because the phone needs to cool down... So yeah my phone also had an overheating issue like the bus!

{"id": "mz70w3d", "title": "Comment on: Total Fail Travel Stories?...", "content": "In 2013 I went to Chile solo for two weeks. The first few days in Santiago were, fine, then the outdoor activities started. I took a three day horseback riding trip, for which the group ended up being me, a super enthusiastic guide, and a very nice, extremely fit, Belgian family of four. Day two, we went on a hike, joined by an eager puppy. It became clear to me that I was out of my league athletically, but I refused to admit this, and kept pushing to keep up, until the puppy ran between my legs and I fell, with one knee on a rock and the other on a tree root. I was relieved- a perfect excuse to give up and go back down the hill. The next day, we were heading back on horseback and, trying to relieve the pain in my bruised and swollen knees, I stretched my leg out. The toe of my boot collided with a rock sticking out of an embankment and was wrenched to the side. I could instantly feel my ankle starting to swell. Did I tell anyone? Ask for help getting away from the remote campsite? No! I rode the horse for hours more, then got off and limped a mile+ up the path to wait an hour for the bus to come to take me back to town. No rest, ice, or elevation for me! I moved along to the next spot on my itinerary, where I canceled my planned outdoor activities in favor of guided minibus tours with minimal walking. After a few days of relaxation, I limped to the bus stop. Along the way, two little kids ran past me and bumped my bag, caused me to stumble, turn, and twist my back. This aggravated an existing injury. I know that the best way to deal with it is to sit up straight and move around regularly. Did I do this? No! I had splurged on a first class bus seat, which I reclined and did not move out of for six hours. When I arrived, I could barely get out of the seat, and couldn't stand up straight. Somehow, with the help of a very worried cab driver, I got from the bus station to my hotel in Santiago, and after a few days, back home. Once home, I continued to limp around on my swollen ankle for months, and never got medical help. This was very stupid. At this very moment, I am wearing a brace on that ankle because it started aching overnight. I did learn my lesson, though, and actually got treatment when I twisted the other ankle in Mexico a few years later. That ankle is fine now. A few notes: \\-no puppies or children were harmed on this journey \\-the trip also featured a small earthquake, a small hotel fire, the largest demonstrations in Santiago in a decade, multiple tours canceled by abnormal weather, several museums that closed for renovations the day I arrived... \\-Chile is amazing.

I bought a weird bike from someone on a forum that kept breaking down. I lacked the knowledge for how to fix it properly but kept it just about going until the South of Germany where I had one break down too many and gave up and decided to go home. I did that tour really really badly in every way - tried to go too far each day, failed to do my laundry as I had this weird method of drying clothes on my bike which only resulted in them getting dirty again (and taking a rest day, checking into a hostel or hotel and using a washing machine/dryer/launderette apparently offended something dumbass and macho I was trying to prove to myself). Even after I'd given up I screwed up my journey home by managing to get on the exact same wrong train... TWICE. First time ticket guard told me I was on the wrong train and I dutifully got off at the next station. Only to find it was one of those tiny rural stations with a platform only on one side, so to get back to my starting point I decided to wheel my broken down bike 10+ miles to the initial station. I kept telling my self \"remember to cross the footbridge when you get to the station\". Which I did. Problem was that I failed to notice that somewhere on my long tiring walk I must have crossed over the railway line. This time round again a ticket guard told me to get off but I'd had it at this point so I just let her shout at me in German until the station after which was at least a normal two-way station. 6 more trains, two nights sleeping on stations, one minor interrogation from the police (remember my clothes were filthy due to the laundry mishap and I was also surrounded by bin bags as I'd disassembled my bike and panniers into bin bags to get it on trains) and I was home. I took me 8 years before I had the courage to attempt a cycle tour again. This time round I actually planned it well, took a normal sensible bike I understood well (having built it myself), had wonderful sightseeing days in hostels chilling with other backpackers and doing my laundry in addition to the wonderful long cycling days sometimes sleeping under the stars and, all in all, spent an amazing mostly trouble free month cycling round the Balkans.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhk7x7", "score": 4, "created_date": "2025-06-22T23:18:27+00:00", "author": "GivUp-makingAnAcct", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lhk7x7/total_fail_travel_stories/mz8irtc/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2263, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:26:08.068168+00:00"}

I visited Chinatown at night, it was nice but not that much to see. You should eat at one of the many street restaurants there though. I would use the Ayutthaya day to visit other places in Bangkok honestly. Angkor was awesome and probably the highlight of my SEA trip, you could spend easily three days there. I strongly recommend ditching the Siem Reap temple and go visit the Angkor Museum instead, it will help you better understand and appreciate all the temples you're going to be visiting. It wouldn't be a bad idea to schedule a guided tour for the temples actually, the guides will explain the history and all the religious and historic symbolism in all the temples, makes for a better trip. If you don't want to (or can't pay) and simply want to visit the temples with a tuk tuk driver, there are literally hundreds of guides waiting outside of Angkor Wat that can provide a tour for that complex, strongly recommend this (I didn't see too many guides in the other temples). Same as in Bangkok, is gets super hot there, so dress accordingly, bring a lot of water and pace yourself while wandering around the area. Angkor Market is just your stereotypical super touristy area, not terrible or anything, just all the shops selling the same souvenirs, slightly overpriced restaurants and bars, etc. Nothing special about it.

{"id": "mz65uoi", "title": "Comment on: 19M solo trip ‚Äì 3.5 weeks through Italy, France, Spain & Portugal ‚Äì feedback & tips welcome!...", "content": "I recommend looking at this agenda from some different angles. 1. Logistics. This is a lot of traveling between destinations, at the expense of getting to spend time exploring. Example: The average range for a train journey between Cinque Terre and Nice is 5 ‚Äì 6 ¬Ω hours. This depends on when you leave and how many transfers are involved. And this is only the train journey. You need to add in the total travel time ‚Äì loading up your bag, checking out, getting to the train station, finding the platform, boarding, and then once you arrive, getting out off the train and out of the station, finding your new lodgings, checking in, and dropping off your stuff. I usually budget hours for that. This brings your transit to 7 ‚Äì 8 ¬Ω hours. This will eat up much of one of your days, so you‚Äôll really just have one day to explore the city. 2. Sights and Activities. What do you want to do and see in each place. Once you know how much time you‚Äôll actually have to explore, is it enough for you? If your primary focus is partying in as many cities as you can, then this may work. But if you want the culture or sights, you may want to cut out some of the locations. 3. If partying is a primary goal, do you really need to switch locations every other day? People will be coming and going from these cities, so your chances of meeting new people every night are pretty good. 4. What do you expect your schedule to be? Do you expect to stay up late and get sleep into part of the morning? If yes, then your time to explore may be limited, based on their operating hours. And how will this play into having to spend hours on a train? 5. Is this your only chance to visit Europe? If not, maybe put some of these destinations onto your ‚Äúnext time‚Äù list.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhn8s0", "score": 3, "created_date": "2025-06-22T15:55:27+00:00", "author": "HMWmsn", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lhn8s0/19m_solo_trip_35_weeks_through_italy_france_spain/mz65uoi/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1743, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:26:12.611125+00:00"}

Then you go through passport and security control. Make sure that liquids and other items are all security-approved and easily accessible. Be polite to staff, don't get nervous if they're not polite to you, they have a shitty job. Bring enough time in advance. If you're nervous, I'd say at least 3-4 hours.

They might be grumpy but that‚Äôs not personal, just be polite unlike the rude travelers. Every major airline has a FAQ, often with videos about the travel process on their website. They also have information about what to pack where, name tags on all your bags is always a good idea. With your level of anxiety, I‚Äôd recommend not booking the budget fare, but go for at least the next highest category so you can choose your seat, prepay baggage fees if needed. You can also usually tick a box or write in that you would like assistance - so that could be someone to help you get to the gate. Make sure you have travel insurance so if your flight got cancelled, you‚Äôve got a fall back plan, etc. Every major (especially) international airport also has a website - with maps, instructions, recommended timing etc. The most important signs airport areas are check in & bag drop, then on your ticket it‚Äôll say which gate once you go through security. Then once you land, it‚Äôs baggage claim, ground transportation. Your baggage will be on the carousel with your flight number. The signs in the airport are simple because that‚Äôs the universal language for people even with limited literacy - they can identify a number or the toilet sign etc. I know you say you don‚Äôt have mental illness but what you‚Äôre discussing is pretty severe anxiety.

For most first times, you‚Äôll just have to bite the bullet and go for it. That goes for you going, and for her handling you going. Her anxiety is something she has to manage, unless you plan on managing her emotions forever. That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt find ways to help her out. It sounds like you‚Äôve done some amount of homework (planning your route, saving up, etc.). It might be helpful to sit your mom down and hear her out on her anxiety. She says she‚Äôs worried about other people; does she not worry about other people in the UK? She wants you to find a group of people (I assume strangers?) before you go; why does she trust those people but not the locals? Then walk through how you did your homework - where exactly are you going and are they popular tourist spots; have you researched safety for solo brown girls (e.g., I am Chinese and will almost always try and look up experiences of other folks who look like me because we experience places differently than white folks); for experiences, are they booked through reputable places (e.g., a popular tour versus an Airbnb experience with no reviews); how much emergency funds you have prepared (if you have enough, maybe show her that you always have enough for a backup option to buy a ticket home if you needed). Maybe also come up with a plan to keep in touch, maybe a text at the end of the day everyday or every other day (or however long you think you‚Äôd be comfortable with), or share photos of places you‚Äôre at so you can both tell her you‚Äôve arrived safely AND are having a good time. She‚Äôs still going to worry because that‚Äôs just how it goes sometimes. I‚Äôve not personally been to SE Asia but it‚Äôs somewhere I‚Äôm eyeing for solo trips, but it might also be worth telling her that you‚Äôre not just going off on your own without due diligence. There are places I wouldn‚Äôt travel solo as much as I‚Äôd like to, and if that‚Äôs the case for you, you can tell her that too to show that you‚Äôre not just being reckless. You‚Äôre young and this is new for both of you, and also she‚Äôs your mom, so there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôs not going to worry, but while you‚Äôre not responsible for her feelings you can try your best. If she‚Äôs still not on board, that‚Äôs unfortunate, but you‚Äôll know you‚Äôve done your best. Source: My (very Chinese, despite us immigrating to Canada, so similar boat here) parents threw a raging fit when I told them I plan to solo travel. To this day (I‚Äôm 30F), the first thing they ask when I say I‚Äôm going somewhere is ‚Äúare you going with anyone‚Äù. I‚Äôm definitely in the camp of ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and sometimes I don‚Äôt even tell them where I‚Äôm going until I‚Äôve come back, but I understand that‚Äôs not the advice you‚Äôre looking for.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lh6rea", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-21T23:14:59+00:00", "author": "iamtheballoon", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lh6rea/my_mum_is_insanely_worried_about_me_22f_brown/mz2crde/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2742, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:26:25.464459+00:00"}

Alicante city, is a very touristy city, so won't be a problem finding stuff to see or do. A nice visit in my opinion, and can easily spend several days there. I went on a guided tour in the city, I don't remember the name .. but something like \"tasting tour of Alicante\" - it started in the Mercat Central, and included a water and a taste of local pork and cheese (I think it was), then a bus trip to the fort, and ending at a small cafe that also included a small sandwich .. So it was very worth the price. Altea, a small town east of Alicante, along the coast. Some friends in the area (from Alcoy) recommended it. A very beautiful town. Steep roads though. I didn't spend much time there so I cannot really give a review tbh. El Castell de Guadalest. Northwest'ish of Altea. An old fort on top of a mountain peak .. sort of. Interesting place. Would say it is worth it if you are in the area anyway. Very touristy. Felt like half the town was just parking for cars, and so many souvenir shops - not that that's a bad thing, unless you tend to focus on that stuff.. Alcoy, the reason for my visit in the area. I went a couple of times for business reasons and to visit friends. A small city north of Alicante on the main road to Valencia. It is not at tourist city - not many speak English there, but a Translate App or if you speak (Castilian) Spanish you'll be fine, plus everyone is very friendly. They do though mainly speak Valencian there.. IMO, it's a really nice city. Very different from cities here in Denmark, which maybe makes it more interesting to me.

Group Tours Pros: the trip is planned for you, some companies will pair you up with a roommate (cheaper for hotels), you don't have to worry about logistics, language (altho not too big a deal as many people in the world will speak some English). I think it's easier to have (touristy) experiences unique to the place you're traveling to. Cons: you're on their schedule. So maybe earlier mornings than you'd normally like, days can be go-go-go, you don't have flexibility if you want to stay somewhere longer or shorter, other people in your group could be annoying. Solo travel Pros: everything is your choice (sights to see, scheduling, choice of restaurant), more peaceful, more opportunity to chat with local people Cons: takes more of your time to plan, more pressure if you're picking the right things (you are, lol), you may feel lonely at times, no one to share new experiences with, language may be an issue at times (but not too big a deal). I've gone on 3 GAP Adventures trips (Rwanda/Uganda, Central Asia, and Antarctica) and 1 Exodus trip (cycling in Romania. I enjoyed the trips with both companies and thought they were good. They each have lots of options. My tip would be to book a couple extra days at the start and end points of the tour so you have time to explore there on your own (you may never return there again). I've also planned my own, multi-week trips (Paris, Scotland, Italy, Vienna, Vietnam, Phnom Penh, South Africa, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Chile, Colombia, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, etc.). The way I plan is 1) pick the place I want to go, 2) buy airline/train tickets (between cities), 3) buy hotels, 4) pick sights to visit. Sometimes I research these things all together. Resources that I use to research: ask friends/acquaintances who've visited there, check itineraries online from the aforementioned tour groups, guidebooks (I check them out from library and then maybe purchase one that I thought was good), and Internet. For the Internet, I've found Adventurous Kate and Nomadic Matt especially helpful. But there are lots of useful sites. For guidebooks, I like Rough Guides, Lonely Planet, and I really like Rick Steves (for Europe). Check out his website too. The main things I buy in advance are the plane tix, hotel, and attractions that you must pre-book or you don't want to miss out on. I don't necessarily schedule out my day to day activities. For most things, I just have a list of a few things I want to do in that city, but I don't schedule them in advance.

{"id": "mz0u6mh", "title": "Comment on: Creepy Corsica...", "content": "It's both, local culture, and they don't like Germans. I have relatives there so I know very well. If you go to small villages you can be welcomed \"as family\". But I guess you have been to touristic places where people are quite rude. Even if most of the economy relies on tourism, they don't like tourists. Thing with Germans (as Austrian they probably took you for a German) is that about 15 years ago, some German tourist book started to list the places like river holes for swimming where locals used to go with family for chilling during summer. As a child I spent lots of summers in Corsica and our main activities were hiking and spending the afternoon at the river to swimm. Now, it's impossible to go because it's full of German tourists. So locals feel (rightfully) they can't enjoy their spots anymore. This is why they don't like Germans Another reason and why Germans in particular, is many German tourists come with big cars and don't know how to drive in sinuous mountain roads. Locals don't mind backing up near the cliff but you see in summer a huge traffic jam because a tourist is too scared to do so with their pristine SUV. Frenchs from \"the continent\" still do better than central Europeans. Thus the hate for German cars in particular. It's attached to the stereotype of \"this guy gonna cause a traffic jam and I will be late again for work\" The problem is overtourism in Corsica. And German tourists are, for some reasons, seen as the ones outplacing locals. Tourists also outprice locals by buying secondary houses and there is a huge economic crisis there. Locals have low pay jobs and can't live in their village anymore. Now for the culture, it's an island. People from cities are rude because too much tourism. People from villages will be welcoming tourists but not if you plan to stay for long and are not from there for 5 generations. There is some quite backward mentalities.

I haven‚Äôt been to everywhere on your list but Guilin is my favourite - you can do some actual hiking around rice fields (as opposed to just climbing steps at many other popular natural sites) or just get a cable car up Longji rice terraces. One day scootering around the landscape and one day in the rice terraces might be okay but may be a lot if you also arrived on that day. I felt Chongqing had more things to see than Chengdu and felt a lot bigger. I think Shenzhen and Guangzhou are skippable as a tourist. You need to book tickets to the Nanjing massacre museum in advance as they sell out. In Shanghai if you don‚Äôt want to pay to go up the tallest building, there is the tallest restaurant, Heavenly Jin, which some people take the elevator up to ‚Äúbrowse the menu‚Äù and take photos. It will help with your planning to include the train travel times as this will impact how long you spend in each place. For example, you might say Guilin for two days but I would suggest arriving day 1, two full days for activities then leave day 4. Also some days will be fully taken up by the train journey / getting to the hotel. Chinese airports tend be very efficient and may work out similar price to trains btw. I used trip.com to book my trains as they will automatically try and book your preferred train as soon as it goes on sale two weeks before the travel date. If they bought a ticket you don‚Äôt want them you can just cancel it after and try and find your own one (12306 is the app most people will recommend but it‚Äôs a bit more difficult for English speakers).

Stay the night, it's not worth the hassle of day trips. I also used to live in Guangzhou, not really much to see there, but there's a cool vibe. Maybe stay one day before going straight to Hong Kong, Shenzhen is shit. It's cool if you like bleep bloop, but there's no history there. Guilin and ZJJ, I have been to Guilin but never ZJJ. People tell me the vibe is nicer in Guilin / Yangshuo, while ZJJ is more about looking at cool mountains. China has this habit of turning every tourist activity into a total fucking ordeal. Maybe a niche thing, but China has a nascent underground music scene and you can find some pretty nice gigs in different cities if you use the app Showstart, it's like Chinese ticket master.

If water is plentiful, I carry 2 liters. Never carry less than 2 bottles, even if you only have water in one of them in case one breaks. Some routes will enable a water cache, where you travel to a point on your route before your hike starts and stash water under a tree. Then when you come to that spot on your hike you can fill up. Zion NP traverse works well for a water cache. Lastly do not drink unfiltered water or snow. The dangers associated with waterborne illness in the backcountry are very high even if the likelihood is low. Running out of water sucks. All of those planning scenarios have happened to me. The heat exhaustion was the worst because it was my 12 yr old daughter on her first backpacking trip in the Badlands where there is no shade and no water.

{"id": "mz9s6cf", "title": "Comment on: New to backpacking, how to water?...", "content": "Where are you going? How much water do you typically need when day hiking? How do you carry that? Adapt the system you're comfortable with. I use a water bottle to drink from while hiking and a katadyn be free filter with two cnoc vecto containers and a sawyer coupler to create a gravity filtration system so that I can refill at streams. One cnoc container is marked with red permanent marker as the dirty waster container, and one is marked in blue for clean water. I use the dirty one to collect water from the stream (or lake, or whatever) and then screw the filter on. Then I clean my hands and attach the clean container to the output of the filter using the coupler and hang the whole system up with some cord. I am careful to make sure no drips of unfiltered water touch the clean parts of the system. The water flows from the dirty container on top through the filter into the clean one. When I come back to it after ten or so minutes, I remove the clean container first and carefully cap it and set it aside for use. Then I cap the filter outlet to keep that clean, and remove it from the dirty container, which is left hanging open to dry and be packed up later. The filter goes into a zip lock bag and lives in the foot of my sleeping bag to prevent freezing overnight, which can rupture the filter and ruin it. I used to use a handheld pump filter by MSR, and I have a friend who still prefers that style. I always check the maps to see where the water is on a route. If the trail follows a stream and I know it will be flowing, then I know I can refill often and so carry less water weight. If the trail does not follow a reliable stream, and maybe only crosses one every few miles, then I need to be more careful and make sure I am carrying enough water to make it between sources. Many campsites will be within a five minute walk of a water source, if not, it is known as a \"dry camp\" and you need to make sure you have enough to cook dinner and stay hydrated overnight, as well as start the next day and get to the next source.

{"id": "mz9vnzd", "title": "Comment on: New to backpacking, how to water?...", "content": "I'll just include anything you might need to cover: people already mentioned, but if you want to just be done with it - get a sawyer squeeze and a CNOC 2L bag that matches the threading. Alternative options for the filter are Katadyn Befree, and Platypus Quickdraw. The CNOC bag is way more durable than anything that comes with the filters normally, and getting a hole in your dirty water bag is a bad time, so I recommend getting one of those bags regardless of the filter. Carry a 1L lifewater bottle or similar that you can filter your water into for drinking it on the move. You can also use a nalgene if you want or something fancier, but re-using a big water bottle is cheap and lightweight. That allows you to have 3L on you after stopping for water if you know you wont get to another source anytime soon (more on that at the bottom). Use electrolytes while hiking. Nuun is popular because it isnt filled with trash and it dissolved itself nicely without you needing to shake the bottle. I prefer salt stick caps. I just pop one in every 3-4 miles and have a big helping of water. Pick something you wont get sick of because you NEED to get electrolytes in while backpacking. If you are walking along and the rings on your fingers feel like they are getting tight or your fingers start to feel like sausages, you (probably) have hyponatremia. It does NOT mean you should chug plain water, as that will make it worse. It DOES mean that you don't have enough electrolytes and you should take some immediately to prevent it from getting worse. Again - drinking water by itself when this happens because you feel \"dehydrated\" will make things worse as it will just dilute the small amount of electrolytes you still have, you need that water to be full of electrolytes or you are not helping. Marathon runners have this issue and many end up in the hospital drinking plain water during their run. Try to plan your drinking water sources. Most trails have guides you can get either in an app or in paper form somewhere. Just regular maps on your phone can also show you streams, rivers and lakes too. I always carry a little more water than I think I will need because not having water when a water source is dried up is a not so fun time. For meals - you will probably be eating freeze dried ones. Take those into account when thinking about how much water you need at the end of the day. The meals need water - eating will make you more thirsty - digestion requires more water. The meals themselves are usually high in sodium. That's really not a bad thing if you are hiking most of the day as salt is the major electrolyte your body needs. so its a nice free electrolyte boost. Peak Refuel are the best calorie to water ratio for meals I have seen. The requirement for water is also why people like to take their lunch near to a water source - if you need more, no problem its right there. If your filter is exposed to freezing temperatures at all, it is probably not going to filter anymore but will \\*look\\* like its working. So - bring a snack size ziplock bag with you and get in the habit of putting your filter in it and tossing it into your sleeping bag when you go to bed (make sure the \"clean\" end has a cap to keep the dirty water away from it). That way the habit is formed and when its freezing outside at night you dont have to try to remember to do that before going to sleep. It also protects you from sudden unexpected temp drops at night. Randomly also related to water but not related to drinking it - If your socks get wet (use wool socks only), just wring them out and toss them in the bottom of your sleeping bag at night. Its the only way I have ever gotten them to dry before morning. You can hang them out and they will dry a little, but it sucks putting on ice cold socks in the morning first thing.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1li67w9", "score": 3, "created_date": "2025-06-23T04:13:36+00:00", "author": "Girafferage", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1li67w9/new_to_backpacking_how_to_water/mz9vnzd/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 3830, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:26:46.235587+00:00"}

You might be able to leave behind the cup and the bowl, I usually eat and drink out of the pot. If one of your phones is a work phone I suggest you enjoy your trip and leave it behind. When I first was backpacking I used to bring makeup too. But truly, once you do it once or twice you never think about it bc you don‚Äôt have access to your reflection. I think it‚Äôs good exposure therapy and builds confidence not wearing makeup all the time. You probably need a trowel. Consider taking smaller versions of any toiletries and/or putting them in smaller containers. Maybe check marketplace or the gear trade subreddit to look for a lighter pack/ tent/ sleeping bag. 7 lbs for 7 days of food sounds a bit low imo. But idk how long/ rigorous your hike is or what food you are packing. I believe 100-200 calories per mile of hiking depending on elevation/ pack weight/ body weight, is typical.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lhz196", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-23T01:13:30+00:00", "author": "Big_Cans_0516", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1lhz196/for_my_6_or_7_day_west_coast_trail_feedback/mz92jfm/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1228, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:26:50.690637+00:00"}

{"id": "mz7olpp", "title": "Comment on: Should I just send it or wait?...", "content": "Some comments here are condescending AF - chill out guys, remember being 19!?!? Anyways, off the top of my head - go hitchhiking, ideally with a buddy. I did a jailbreak at uni from the UK to Morocco without a coin in my pocket and made some of the most valuable experiences of my life. Helps to have a young, attractive female friend with you, you get picked up about 10x as much as if you were hitchhiking on your own as a male. Little tip on the side - a large stuffed toy animal and or guitar hanging visibly out of your backpack also helps with getting picked up, not as much as young lady friends though ;) If I were in the US, I'd definitely hit those big trails too, I'm so jelly you got those. I don't know what others are going on about having to save so much money upfront- hiking is about the cheapest way to live and travel, you'll learn how little you really need. Save enough to fill your belly for a few months, which isn't that much money at the end of the day if you think mainly of basic groceries. Get cheap outdoor gear and work your way up through the years, once you know what you really want to spend money on. My wife did work and travel in Australia in her teens, which she remembers as fondly as I remember my hitchhiking days. Last but not least, you could also do a pilgrimage. Here in Europe we've got the Camino de Santiago, a huge network of pilgrimage hiking trails with a network of cheap hostels (dunno if you for something similar stateside). A buddy of mine did that recently and just can't shut up about it - he's an atheist and claimed that many people doing pilgrimages are, i.e. it's not about religion for many people doing this. He met friends for life and claims to have had the busiest sexual schedule during the Camino, so there's that... ;) Anyway - don't let boomers on here discourage you - take risks, mess up, learn, repeat...

All the info below is from Google (and my own experience). INR 40k is about SGD 600 per person. You said you'll be there for 6 days, so that's $100 a day. Singapore is expensive but you can make it work if you budget accordingly. Eat at hawker centres for $5-$10 a meal depending on where you go, what you eat, and how much you eat. That will be $30 max if you eat three solid meals a day. Public transport will be about $5-$7. It's only hostels or hotels in Singapore, there are no airbnbs. The average dorm is about $35 a night per person from what I can see on Hostelworld. Hotels are expensive but I guess you'll split the cost with your cousins. Free attractions: walking along Orchard Road, city parks (e.g. Fort Canning Park, Pearl's Hill), Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Gallery, the Asian Civilisations Museum, SAM, free shows at the Esplanade, Kampong Glam, Little India, Chinatown, free guided tours, nature reserves, etc. To go back to your original question: is it a good travel plan for you and your cousins?

You can bus to places like Niagara falls, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, hell even Nova Scotia by the via rail if you're up for it. In terms of Toronto itself, unless you're coming for a specific event, there's not a whole lot to do in Toronto. It's a really trendy city though so everything you've heard of online like nut milks, dark Pilates, sauna wellness, head spas, matcha flights, stuff will be around the corner. Theres also probably every food you can think of, but the authenticity might not be 100%.

Nusa Penida is super close ‚Äî like a 30-minute fast boat from Bali ‚Äî and it feels like stepping into another world. The cliffs are unreal (Kelingking Beach is the one that looks like a T-Rex), the water is crazy blue, and you can snorkel with manta rays if you time it right. It‚Äôs a bit rough around the edges ‚Äî bumpy roads, not a luxury vibe ‚Äî but that‚Äôs kind of what makes it cool. It‚Äôs raw, dramatic, and doesn‚Äôt feel too touristy once you‚Äôre out exploring. Komodo (Labuan Bajo), though‚Ä¶ man, that place is next level. Flying there from Bali takes a bit more effort, but it *feels* like you‚Äôre at the edge of the world. The island views from Padar, the pink sand beaches, the insane snorkeling, and yeah ‚Äî seeing actual Komodo dragons in the wild? Wild. It‚Äôs the kind of place that sticks with you.

{"id": "mza5zkh", "title": "Comment on: Tanzania and Zanzibar or Thailand. Help please!...", "content": "Hi. I have not been to Thailand but have to Tanzania and did pretty much the trip you have in mind. We spent 5 days on safari which we absolutely loved and 5 days in Zanzibar. Retrospectively, I would have spent couple of more days on the safari. It might be an unpopular opinion but our experience in Zanzibar was a little reality check. We stayed in a small, lovely place but quickly came to realize that the majority of establishments are owned by Europeans. The manager of our BnB was European too. When we stepped outside to walk on the beach, we were surrounded by little kids begging for money. In between all the expensive hotels that cost a bomb were poor locals. It seriously made us wonder whether tourism was benefiting them at all. To top it off, the waters were full of sea weed washing up in September, and was not really suitable for swimming. If you plan to go to Zanzibar, perhaps you could consider supporting local businesses. Ally Jape (he has an instagram page but perhaps also other means of contact if you google) was an excellent young man, a local tour guide that showed us around Stone town and I believe also organizes other trips. Perhaps he also has places owned by locals he can recommend for a stay. All the best.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1li4591", "score": 2, "created_date": "2025-06-23T05:36:00+00:00", "author": "Orgasmblush25", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1li4591/tanzania_and_zanzibar_or_thailand_help_please/mza5zkh/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1245, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:29:47.757270+00:00"}

Everyone seems to be watching videos on their phone as they drove, rules seemed to be barely even guidelines. Even as a passenger I was a bit nervy. This might make you more inclined to drive so you‚Äôre not a passenger, or it might make you think a public bus is a safer alternative.

You're split of days per city seems perfectly reasonable to me. In Dresden I would highly recommend visiting the famous Green Vault, which has the largest treasure collection in Europe. The Frauenkirche and Zwinger palace are also well worth visiting. For the day trip to Saxon Switzerland, I would recommend taking a paddle steamer, perhaps on the way back. I did that and it was very enjoyable [ For Berlin, the Olympic Stadium is definitely worth visiting. I would also recommend the Reichstag (advance booking required), Topography of Terror and the Museum Island (unfortunately the Pergamon Museum is closed). A day trip to Potsdam, just outside Berlin, to visit the Sanssouci palace and gardens is a good idea since you have a decent amount of time in Berlin. For public transport in Germany, the Deutschlandticket makes the most sense. It costs ‚Ç¨58 and is valid for one calendar month. It's valid on virtually all public transport except for IC, ICE and EC trains (which you'll most likely be taking from Dresden to Berlin - book these in advance for the cheapest fares). I think spending 8 days in Germany would easily justify buying it. It also saves all the hassle of purchasing individual tickets. It's a subscription ticket but you can just cancel it immediately. This is one of the easier places to buy it [ Use [ or the DB Navigator app for booking train tickets or planning public transport journeys in Germany.

{"id": "mwzu7o4", "title": "Comment on: A couple from china punch Malaysian old man...", "content": "For my non Chinese speaking friends: _~First 10s: Chinese couple arguing why they aren‚Äôt getting served by cashier? They stated they were lining up from the middle. Guy even had the audacity to say ‚Äúme first‚Äù. (but quite obvious they cut line la)~_ Edit #1: For the first 10 seconds, I was told by 2 people that the person said that the couple insisted (though aggressively) that the uncle (or aunty because the Chinese word for ‚Äúhe‚Äùand ‚Äúshe‚Äù sounds the same) was first, and they told it to the cashier. This was followed by ‚ÄúI said He first‚Äù which I may have mistook as ‚ÄúMe first‚Äù. The old man was still annoyed and ask them to line up properly. I re-listen the clip and I‚Äôm still not sure. They could be right, the accent is very thick and I may be mistaken. Personal Thoughts: only reason why I made the first initial translation is because it sounded to me like that, but regardless if the couple insisted that didn‚Äôt cut line, why are they so aggressive to let the man ‚Äúbe first‚Äù, and why the uncle so angry? 10-20s: Uncle telling them eh line up properly la, you don‚Äôt even line up what you talking. Uncle told the couple they they were informed to line up properly, don‚Äôt just cut wherever you want. Aunty (lady wearing the hijab spoke in Chinese, or at least I think it‚Äôs her) also said at the start ‚Äúeh you all Chinese people shouldn‚Äôt act like this‚Äù. 20-25s: Couple clearly getting angry, so is uncle. Uncle tell them you never in line up properly what are you talking about, couple then said stop talking nonsense. 26s-35s: I think the uncle said why you go take my photo? I just ask you to queue up properly what is wrong with you? China guy said aren‚Äôt you the one that want to fight? Edit #2: I was discussing with two users, at first we both thought we misheard, but there is a chance the Chinese guy said ‚ÄùË¶ÅË≠¶ÂØüÂïäÔºå‰Ω†ËÇâÈ™®Ëå∂Ë¶ÅÂêó‚Äù which literally translate to ‚Äúyou want police, or you want to eat Bak Kut Teh‚Äù which is fucking hilarious. Okay the Chinese dude spit a funny bar there 36-45s: uncle clearly annoyed because China couple are disrespecting him. Uncle then shout at them you want to fight go out and fight la. Young guy then reply you dare or not? Uncle also call them you China people all one kind. Couple weren‚Äôt happy 46s+: Young guy was like ‚Äúyou scold China people!? You scold China people? YOU SCOLD CHINA PEOPLE? How about you come and fight China people and we see?‚Äù Uncle then go like ‚Äúcome out and fight, come out la!‚Äù China guy then went like ‚ÄúI come out!‚Äù They then proceed to kiss üíÉüï∫ Obviously this is not an accurate translation but it pretty much summarises the event.

Which I agree with to some extent (about the bashing), but I also agree with his contra-point that why *can't* (some) local Chinese make an effort to learn passable BM? You can't put yourself into a linguistic ghetto and then complain about being in the said ghetto. Then further down, another said that the local Chinese are \"smarter\" because they will concentrate on learning English, which is ***soooooo*** much \"better\" than BM anyway. Of course, why the oh-so-intellectual people there couldn't learn BM alongside English while these PRC can would be an exercise left to the reader üòè And of course there's a smattering of \"well these PRC will be infiltrating us\", which is just tinfoil-y. Me, I just think it's admirable that these guys are making an effort to learn BM. I don't know if they're \"Chinese spies\" (lol) or not, but I admire worthwhile effort. Wish I can put the same amount of work learning German üòÇ (and yes, to address some concerns in this thread: BM is dead easy.

{"id": "mumlnaf", "title": "Comment on: Fair Enough...", "content": "The context for the fork eating rice is quite logical actually for their culture and history. The thing is, British fine dining has assigned roles to every cutleries and they hardly able to go beyond it. For example, you don't use big spoon for desserts. And liquid food are with spoons. Added to the fact that British culture tend to separate their food liquidity ie main course aren't soupy. Soup often have to be eaten separately, either before or after the main course and main course tend to be dry food like steaks and the like. So soup course have spoons and those will be taken away when you are done. And when main course comes, it often have to be eaten with fork and knife. Hence why, when presented with rice which is a dry food, their logic is that it has to be eaten with fork. The upturned fork also mimics the usual eating motion of a fork. You stab a food and bring it to your mouth with upturned fork, not in the manner like a spoon. Heck, using the knife to \"scoop\" the rice also mimics when you eat dry food where the knife often holds down the food item for the fork. Again, this is British fine dining. If British royalty have to go somewhere else and they gave spoon to eat rice, they likely won't make a fuss about it. Of course this depends on which side that \"gave in first\". It's like that the host nation, not wanting to offend or to show they do their work, would use British fine dining etiquette rather their own.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwkgtg", "score": 2, "created_date": "2025-05-28T02:02:47+00:00", "author": "Kozmo9", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1kwkgtg/fair_enough/mumlnaf/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1444, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:31:21.942106+00:00"}

{"id": "myoked2", "title": "Comment on: Indian tenants lashed out after the landlord requested TNB to cut off electricity over unpaid rent a...", "content": "Did not personally experience this, but next-door neighbor did. Our neighbor is an elderly Indian couple who mostly spends their time in Australia to be with their children who had migrated over for a better life. They're only ever back during Christmas. If they‚Äôre not around during the interim, they‚Äôll have their youngest daughter, who still lives in MY, inspect the place half-yearly. The times they were away, they kindly requested dad to keep an eye out on the house and ensured everything was in place. Dad, being the people pleaser that he is, obliged. Anyway, after moving out, they had two tenants rent the place at different points in time, before ultimately deciding they were better off leaving the place uninhabited. First tenant were a pair of Eurasian couple. They were pleasant folks who mostly kept to themselves, stayed for a few months to a year at most before relocating. Think they struggled to fit in. Second tenant, a group of Indian bros, however, genuinely worried my parents. So much that my mom had a period where she was terrified to be seen, and if she ever needed to be out, she‚Äôd keep interactions polite but incredibly minimal. Ditto dad, who had no choice but to engage them in the occasional social niceties to avoid coming off as rude, but took great care to stay private. Before I continue, know that this was close to 13-14 years ago, and social issues such as racial profiling and stereotypes were lesser-known concepts, and that my folks have learned from their ways and attempt to challenge their beliefs whenever possible. These Indian bros were your average typical Indian men. Rowdy, drunkards, paunchy, and looked questionable. 4-5 of them lived in the house, and two of them particularly stood out the most to us. One dude who we considered the \"honcho\" of the bros, looked like a balding rockstar who spoke the most conversational English of the group and was the one who often engaged dad in conversations. Second dude was this humongously tall and burly Indian dude, 6'2'' at least. I've met both on separate occasions where they would wave or nod at me, nothing more. Things went fine for about 4-5 months, before cracks started to show. By the 6th month, I started hearing passing conversations between my parents about how the first dude would often hit my dad up to borrow some money, to which my dad politely declined. What ensued thereafter were more frequent rounds of midnight drinking sessions featuring new faces weekly, where they'd chill and drink in the compound till early morning. Occasionally, I'd see some of them staying in on a weekday. We never knew what they did, but the assumption was they either held odd jobs, were unemployed, or worked questionable jobs. IYKYK. This persisted another 4-6 months. My memory hereon out is foggy at best, but I think the youngest daughter and her husband would come over seeking them, but the tenants were always nowhere to be found when they showed up. From what I heard, it was a case of overdue rentals that eventually piled up. Then came a time where Syabas stripped the house of water, which led to the bros siphoning water from the Chinese family 2 doors down from us. Between calling them out on their behavior and keeping us safe, dad chose the latter. After months of squatting, these Indian bros simply upped and left one day. Thankfully, they never returned to get even or something. Neighbor couldn't recoup their losses, and returned to a home that was in a worse state than they left it, which led them to the decision to never rent their place out again. Funny story about the second dude - A few months into his stay here, I caught him smooching an Indian dude in broad daylight one random Saturday at the alley behind our home. Never ever have I internally squealed and fanboy-ed so hard because it was such a surprising sight. Of all things that could happen, that was certainly one I was not expecting at all LMAO. Especially since LGBTQ was still somewhat frowned upon then. For all the intimidation he was, I saw him in a new light thereafter. Matter of fact, I think he was probably biggest softie of the bros, literally and figuratively. For all the intimidation he looked, he was likely the most harmless.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lfbl1y", "score": 14, "created_date": "2025-06-19T19:18:50+00:00", "author": "PastaFreak26", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1lfbl1y/indian_tenants_lashed_out_after_the_landlord/myoked2/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 4235, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:31:32.665210+00:00"}

The best part is that they know how to enjoy the beauty, every restaurant/cafe/bar has al fresco seating, I don‚Äôt think I had a single meal sitting indoors. The weather was stunning, I expected to be burning, but it was the most pleasant weather. A sundress during the day and a light jacket in the evening, that‚Äôs what dreams are made of. The food is so incredible, it‚Äôs hard to stop eating. I tried every street taco stand and lathered my tacos in the spicy sauces and fresh guac because I figured a tummy ache would be worth it (and my stomach was completely fine). I ate fresh mangos covered in chamoy and tajin everyday and ended the day with a margarita or an aperol spritz. And finally, THE PEOPLE. Everyone is so lovely, every stranger smiles at you, every shop keeper would kindly help me when I mispronounced a word or needed to turn to google translate.

But with South Asians there's still a perception of poverty. Therefore, people will tend to be racist. Also Indians sometimes get mistaken for local Roma people whom we're notoriously racist against. I'm sorry things are like that, but it's just the reality. Think of it this way: if not everyone is nice to you, you can be sure that those who are nice really mean it.

In Italy it was a little more complicated. In the north, particularly in Milan and Turin, I felt way more comfortable and didn‚Äôt have any issues.

There was never any outward discrimination, but it felt like I was not only stared at for my skin color, but also disregarded in a lot of situations. In Amalfi in particular I would walk into shops with my white friends and they‚Äôd be greeted warmly while I was ignored. In restaurants the bill would always be handed to my friends as if I didn‚Äôt have money to pay. There were a lot of double takes and drawn out stares in certain places that just felt uncomfortable.

We've traveled with our kids to Italy, Austria, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Czechia. We've generally stayed at nice places, we dress well and speak English fluently. But this is generally true of many Indian travelers we've encountered - they're curious and strike up a conversation. It's almost always been a positive interaction. The only comment I have is that - this applies generally to tourists from Asia - there's a sweet spot where you sound polite and establish a presence; this lies between being too inscrutable and being pushy, and honestly it takes practice to get right - took awhile for me. This isn't to suggest that such an attitude will eliminate racism, but it smoothens interactions partly because your demeanor conveys that their poor behavior does not generate an emotional response from you. This is very crucial - express an unflappability I've used humor - in Austria in the face of a surly waitress who was friendly to an adjacent table, stating as she left to my wife just loud enough for her to hear \"did you see that ? she seems to have forgotten half her English between the adjacent table and ours.\". And elsewhere - Frankfurt airport ? - I had my order of coffee shoved across the counter with a scowl, so I proceeded to push the money across with an exaggerated scowl on my face before immediately restoring a poker face. Demonstrating that their primitive behavior is a source of amusement to you rather than a cause to be offended is useful to one's mental health while - hopefully - also helpful to them. But beyond a point I don't really care - try to dehumanize me and I'll turn you into a caricature in kind.

{"id": "mx5pjn6", "title": "Comment on: that weird little moment when solo travel makes you feel insanely alive...", "content": "This wasn't during a solo trip, but it was something i experienced all alone while my wife had gone elsewhere (hotel maybe). We had just finished having coffee at this little caf√© which was actually just a home serving coffee on its front porch, sitting on tiny rickety sidewalk-level chairs, watching local life happen around. Wife wanted to walk back right away but i was enjoying the vibe so much, i told her I'd stay a bit longer and bike back to the hotel. When i decided to leave, I asked the caf√© girl if there was a toilet i could use. She said yes and gestured to follow her. She led me into her house, which, as i saw was common in Hoi An, was very narrow and very long, so we walked through the house, past the living room where there was this man sleeping on a mattress on the floor (i speculate that he was a fisherman and works from the wee hours of morning until sunrise), all the way to the back, where there was the kitchen and, right after it, the tiny bathroom, which was just the toilet and the shower. (Everything, and everywhere, in this home was squeaky clean, putting to shame many western homes I've seen in my life) I peed and flushed and exited towards the kitchen sink to wash my hands. Only there was no water coming from the sink, so i started looking around, fidgeting the faucet to see if there was a trick to it. The girl was nearby and saw me and quickly came to help. She also fidgeted, and when it was clear there simply was no running water at that time, she fetched a little bucket and got some water from a large tub, and gestured for me to wash my hands while she poured water from the bucket. I come from a developing country which has had (still has) its water supply issues, so i am familiar with this method. I don't know if it was this, or the girl's very casual friendliness and helpfulness, or both, or something else... But this whole exchange and experience felt very \"real\" and \"safe\" and \"comforting\" to me, despite being utterly unexpected and so different from most of what I've experienced when travelling. After this, the older woman (probably the girl's mother) fetched my bike for me, and we had a bit of small talk... The usual: where are you from, did you enjoy the coffee, etc. And I've had this exact same small talk before, but for some reason this one hit different and this time, i really felt food talking with them (I'm an introvert, and somewhat socially awkward). I hate to sound clich√©, but this family (the girl, and her mother, running the caf√© out of their home) were so welcoming and warm and friendly, that i was like: \"so this is why westerners fall in love with Vietnam\". And it probably is clich√© but here's the thing: all the while, as this was happening, the bathroom scene, the small talk, the guys making shoes on the side porch right behind where the coffee cart was, all of this i was experiencing IN THE MOMENT, meaning i was fully \"in the here and the now\". I knew that my wife was back at the hotel, and somehow having agreed on catching up with each other later, i freed myself to slow myself down and experience this place and moment at my own pace. And as i hopped on the bike i felt like i was sunshining from the inside out, and i rode it slowly amidst the traffic, not nervous at all despite having never ridden a bike in the street amidst traffic before, and me being quite a safety paranoid... I felt, as i rode, fully embodied, fully present, and fully happy. It was a glimmer, and one of the highlights of the trip for me. so even if not a solo trip per se, there are solo moments like these, totally unexpected and unassuming, that can make your whole trip shine.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l7y3dx", "score": 64, "created_date": "2025-06-11T06:43:36+00:00", "author": "ichthyomusa", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l7y3dx/that_weird_little_moment_when_solo_travel_makes/mx5pjn6/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 3660, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:32:44.149666+00:00"}

I've also experienced some great times with people who I know I'll never reconnect with, but ultimately, I've learnt to feel grateful and treasure the memories, and remind myself that if I've been able to build these connections then 100% there will be many more opportunities like this in the horizon.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kux064", "score": 348, "created_date": "2025-05-25T09:59:11+00:00", "author": "ttran0861", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kux064/solo_trip_turned_romantic/mu5by4w/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 827, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:32:54.863711+00:00"}

I met two ladies (Scottish and Finnish) who I became fast friends with due to their wonderful personalities. Once my car was fixed, us three traveled together for the next four months. We headed north towards Darwin, then made our way east towards Townsville, then around the coast towards Sydney. During our travels, I made moves towards the Scottish lady, but she wasn't interested. Turned out that she was a closeted lesbian, which I did have an inkling of but wasn't too sure. I knew the Finnish lady was bisexual from a previous conversation we had when back when we were still in Adelaide. At some point during our travels, the girls fell in love with one another. Although I inevitably became the third wheel, I didn't mind as I helped two people find and express love truthfully without fear of being judged. They both lived together in Scotland for a number of years. They sadly broke up last year, but they remain good friends. I'm still friends with both of them today, and I'm actually planning a trip with the Scottish lady to travel the Netherlands this summer. Hopefully I'll get to travel Finland next year to meet my other friend. I definitely agree that the people you meet make the journey memorable.

The highs for the country are incredibly high. Insanely beautiful, amazing food, wonderful locals who seem genuinely warm and interested in you, comparatively our money goes very far. Reminds me of Southern California on steroids with the mountains/ocean/flora/fauna. Downsides from recent visit was noticing how significant the wealth inequality is there. Everywhere seemed to be owned by white folks and have black employees. I‚Äôve also heard that during loadshedding there were major fears of the power grid failing and it being all out anarchy with no electricity. Probably overhyped but worth noting. I‚Äôve also heard living there in recent times is VERY different than being a tourist. I‚Äôve heard if you have money or are perceived as wealthy, life becomes significantly more dangerous as people may stalk or try to kidnap you.

{"id": "mwyn610", "title": "Comment on: Personal Growth in Solo Travel...", "content": "Solo travel has definitely changed me permanently in so many ways. Growing up I was an incredibly shy and insecure kid, I used to cry when strangers talked to me (when I was out and about with my mom) and had a really hard time just talking to people in general. Few months before I turned 19 I did a 6 week trip to Europe and on my second day I mentally switched off everything that held me back, and went to talk to some people to ask them a simple question. They invited me to hang out with them and I credit everything that snowballed from that moment on to them. Till this day they‚Äôre still great friends! I started to realise that there are so many incredible, kind and giving people out there and I met so many memorable people on that trip. I was definitely that annoying teenager in hostels just clinging on to cool people but that was part of my journey and I don‚Äôt regret it! Was definitely ‚Äòcringe‚Äô at times, but it really made me see the good in humanity. 10 years on, someone who meets me for the first time would describe me as confident, calm and ‚Äòeasy to talk to‚Äô. Truth is, I‚Äôm still really introverted and I‚Äôm still a little shy, but I‚Äôm aware I don‚Äôt come across that way any longer. I‚Äôve also internalized all the kindness and love I‚Äôve received from people I‚Äôve met on the road, and it has given me a huge wealth of kindness and love of my own that I freely give out to everyone I cross paths with now. It has made me more secure in who I am, what I can survive, what I‚Äôm able to offer the world and of the power I hold to make people smile just by making them feel seen and understood. My mind has been opened so much by meeting so many different people from different walks of life. I haven‚Äôt seen nearly as much as I want to, life gets in the way sometimes, but I will forever hold those moments dear to me, and I‚Äôll forever be thankful to every single beautiful person I‚Äôve met that expanded my heart and mind, and thankful to every single beautiful place that has expanded my soul and gratitude to be alive.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l7hcgp", "score": 18, "created_date": "2025-06-10T04:31:35+00:00", "author": "jasonlampa", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l7hcgp/personal_growth_in_solo_travel/mwyn610/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2034, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:33:25.658096+00:00"}

{"id": "mv3nofa", "title": "Comment on: Should I just go home?...", "content": "Let's put aside the fact that someone was an absolutely awful human being. They were. They suck and you deserve better. Let's look at this completely financially. You can get home to JFK tomorrow for $400 on TAP (via Lisbon) from Amsterdam or direct on Jet Blue for $800. Let's assume those prices hold for your trip back, now you are in between $800 and $1600 (plus whatever from JFK) for flights. Is that enough to cover the costs of either all female dorms or single rooms until your school starts? I think it probably is. Female dorms tend to cost a few dollars, let's say $5, more per night... heck let's say $10. So that's $920 for the 92 days of June/July/August. Right in there for the $800 you were going to lose going home. From a financial point of view, I think you're probably better off staying in Europe. Now, as to how you feel (which is worth far more than $800 and is very important), here is my thought. Leave Amsterdam. It's a great city, but not for you anymore. Where is a place you really want to go? Where was next? Go there and try it. Hang out. Female only dorm. Ignore boys. If you still feel like you need to go home after that, you really haven't lost anything but the $30 or so you spend extra on your next site. You had an abysmal experience.

I will be honest: I didn‚Äôt have high expectations considering how incredible Karnak was as well some of the other sites found on the West Bank. Luxor Temple, from the outside, seems like a smaller version of Karnak. However, I would say I was pleasantly surprised! First of all, I appreciate this was the only site open after 5 pm (open till 9 pm!) as well as all the hidden layers found carved in stone here. Alexander the Great as pharaoh is carved here, as well as Christian frescoes painted over the hieroglyphs and an 800 year old mosque built over part of the temple, and still in use. This make Luxor Temple perhaps the oldest continuously used temple in the world - a place where humans have tried to connect to the divine for nearly 4,000 years. Not considering the other sites in ancient Thebes, Luxor is a world-class site and I am glad to have played a very small and insignificant part in its history by visiting it!

You can‚Äôt really go straight up though because the soft sand is just too steep to traverse that way. You have to basically cut your own switchback trail.

My recommendation on how to pack: Sleep system (or as much as can be accommodated) right down the bottom in a separate dry sack. If your pack has a separate section for the bottom: use that. Place the heaviest items along the bottom closest to the back and then up the midline/spine. Sides for medium weight items (take care the weight is evenly balanced) and lightest items to the rear). Absolutely avoid packing anything outside the pack if you can avoid it. Use the side pockets if you must and if you have a pocket on the rear of the pack use that only for light weight stuff. Space in between main section of pack and brain is where I‚Äôd place my wet weather gear so I could access it relatively quickly without diving into my pack. If your pack has a brain only use that for things you may need to access from time to time: I had my powerbank in there if I needed to charge a device while I was walking, wallet, headlamp, sawyer squeeze and back up Katadin water purification tablets, pain medication, small first aid supplies. Pockets on hip belt: snacks, phone, pocket knife, things you‚Äôll potentially use more frequently.

They are leaving gaps in your pack that you desperately need. First the sleeping pad gets unrolled and goes against your back. Next get a garbage or trash compactor bag and put it at the bottom. You stuff your sleeping bag in trying to fill out all the space at the bottom, then your clothes go on top of that. Twist the trash bag so it's \"waterproof-ish\". Then your food goes in which can actually go into a bag. The stove goes next to the food. Then finally your tent goes in and you jam that into all the open spaces. If there isn't much room left I would put the toiletries in the top part, but I think you should have room. Now the bladder is tricky. I would recommend getting 1.5L water bottles and sticking them in the side pocket. If you really want the bladder I think I would either stick it at the top of the pack or maybe better the big back pocket. Put your tent poles on the outside on the side where the straps are.

Anyways how do I deal with ticks?...", "content": "Typical deer ticks (the reddish brown ones) don't last long in the heat or dry environs. Chances are you can leave everything in the car parked in the sun on a hot day and before the sun sets all of them will be dead. If you still feel weird about it, use a vacuum and clean out your car. Clothing - wash in hot water then dry in a dryer. This should do the job. To be extra sure, once clothes are dry, tumble dry on high heat for 15 minutes and you can be certain. Dogs might not find ticks \"itchy\" initially. You'll have to check under the fur yourself. Don't be surprised if you feel some right away or if they're so small you don't feel them at all. Check with your vet - they do make treatments for ticks that will get ticks on your dog to die or leave AND they can be vaccinated against lyme disease (which ticks are the primary vector for us and the dogs). They do make tick and flea shampoos that contain permethrin (other posts mention this chemical) that will convince ticks to back out or just cause them to fall off and die. But read the instructions - don't overdose your pet on permethrin and don't forget to wash it out a day or two later. Check each other over including ALL your crevasses. Ticks love finding these places to burrow into. To remove ticks, get a pair of tweezers, grip the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull upward and away with firm and gentle pressure until the tick naturally releases its bite (in my experience this happens within 2-10 seconds). You don't want to rip the head off and leave it in your skin, it'll increase your risk of infection. Don't squish the tick between your fingers - again, infection. Just drop the tick in some alcohol or soapy water and that should do them in. At the end of the day avoid tick season and high tick areas. Pretreat clothing and equipment with permethrin spray. Use a little deet repellant on your exposed skin. Avoid walking through tall grass and brush. That's pretty much it.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l125jl", "score": 3, "created_date": "2025-06-02T01:51:41+00:00", "author": "NewBasaltPineapple", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1l125jl/officially_a_backpacker_anyways_how_do_i_deal/mvioco6/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1968, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:34:34.263820+00:00"}

I live about 7 miles from The Mendip Hills here in the UK, and I'm a firm believer that you don't need to book expensive plane tickets to get your travelling/backpacking adventure fix. (I understand I'm quite lucky to live where I do). Every weekend recently has consisted of this action. I finish work at 13:30 on a Friday and get straight onto the footpaths with my pack, tent, camera and enough food (generally MRE's) pre packed the night before. There's something super special about the UK is the footpaths system is AMAZING. With Ordinance Survey maps, I can just wander and wander, find a spot to camp and rinse and repeat. I've almost started to see it as a bit of a challenge to do it as cheapy as possible, but also to be entirely self sufficient without the need for public transport etc. Hopefully this classes as backpacking?", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kxprv8", "score": 16, "created_date": "2025-05-28T19:21:22+00:00", "author": "PHASES_UK", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1kxprv8/keeping_it_local_and_still_getting_my_backpacking/mur3pfb/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 996, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:34:39.219924+00:00"}

I'm using my ticket to pass the gate to the platforms area, there's no train on platform 11, but it's a bit early and Spanish trains are known to be late, right? Anyway, 10 minutes till expected departure, and there's no train. There's a high-speed train on a platform 14A in another area though, but it clearly says \"Ciudad Real\" and not \"Villena\". And my train is not supposed to be high-speed anyway. 5 minutes, nothing. 0, nothing. 10 minutes after the expected departure, a beated-up New York subway-style train arrives at platform 11, with clearly no intentions of going anywhere. Caught the train driver, he's not going to Villena and have no idea. High-speed train from platform 14A leaves Well, having no options, I'm going back to the railway station building, where the platform gate guy is making a surprised pikachu face and asking - what happened, your train just left! Yes, turned out that high-speed train to Ciudad Real on platform 14A was indeed my commuter train to Villena on a platform 11 and it's obvious! How fucking come?

{"id": "mweb1zv", "title": "Comment on: Taipei is overrated as a digital nomad destination...", "content": "Taiwanese here. I know I'm biased, but I've also traveled to 30+ countries, some of them as a digital nomad, and currently live in the most diverse city in the world, so I think I can try to give an unbiased answer. I think most people who love Taiwan value mega-city safety and cleanliness. My understanding is that if you are working in a coffee shop in Bangkok, Paris, etc., you cannot just leave your laptop to go to the restroom and have it still be there when it's back. In Taiwan, you can. Another hypothesis for why many expats love Taiwan: they love the politeness and orderliness of Japan but don't like how expensive it is or how cold/superficial/overly rigid Japanese people can be. Taiwanese society is generally more polite/friendly towards strangers (than say, Chinese or Koreans) but still have that East Asian orderliness about it. For long-term stays, Taiwan also has one of the best healthcare in the world, both in terms of affordability and quality. E.g. We have pioneered some cardiology research globally. As a girl, the quality of nail/hair/lash salon treatments in Taiwan are also generally quite high. Housing: yes, most Taiwanese housing are quite ugly from the outside, and many are out of date - as a Taiwanese, it's an embarrassment! However, if you know the history of Taiwan, then it makes more sense. We really need to work on it though! Finally, re: food: I think you just weren't patient/adventurous (food-wise) enough :) Taiwanese *night market* staples that aren't fried: - Oyster omelette - Sausage inside sausage - Bawan meat balls - Vermicelli soup - Grilled squid - Coffin bread (variety of veggies inside) - Sticky rice in bamboo (usually comes with mushroom and meat) - Papaya milk These should be available at most night markets. Again, none of them are fried. Fried oyster mushroom is really popular though - and is healthier than french fries or friend chicken. Re: food diversity, again I think you perhaps weren't looking in the right places. Traditional Taiwanese food is filled with all types vegetable dishes, and is probably one of the most vegan-friendly countries in the world. If you're not vegan, you still benefit from having access to lots of healthy vegatable dishes. If you're looking beyond Taiwanese food, here is a sample of how diverse Taiwanese food can be: Sure, it'll be hard to find good Mexican or Ethiopian food, but I really think the Taiwanese restaurant scene is decently diverse. FYI, my experience/benchmark for food \"diversity\" is NYC.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l4xlwk", "score": 18, "created_date": "2025-06-06T22:35:36+00:00", "author": "TheXXStory", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1l4xlwk/taipei_is_overrated_as_a_digital_nomad_destination/mweb1zv/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2511, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:35:41.353641+00:00"}

Smog is better, traffic is better, hiking is better, spa is better, beach is better. The only thing I give Thailand the edge on is food.

Taiwan does not have this culture of scamming people like Thailand does at all. It‚Äôs so refreshing. Honestly there isn‚Äôt much about Bangkok I like more that Taiwan. I like hiking, hot springs, diving, nature, walking around parks. The feeling of not being surrounded by nothing but concrete. Biking which is nearly impossible with the traffic in BKK. Imo life is better in Taipei in nearly every conceivable way. I don‚Äôt smoke weed or fuck prostitutes or like being surrounded by the type of tourists and foreigners that do.

I was 24 when I started doing this, just out of college, only a couple of years under my belt as a postgrad working professional, with a first love and a bakers dozen of experiences. I didn't decide to nomad because I had some giant need to explore the world. What made the idea of doing it feasible and a possibility was how easy I was able to imagine myself leaving my established friends and family behind. None were shocked by my choice. Martial arts has been my thing. Its what drove me to pursue nomadding. I wanted to train at my friends gyms in Japan and Thailand. I spent my first year going back and forth between there primarily. It‚Äôs also how I meet people wherever I go. I always go and stay in places with gyms. At first I might not have known anyone when I landed, but after 12 years I've put down enough roots that I have friends and family, a community in which I cycle through on my journey, As a solitary person, I show up to train, and end up finding people who become friends, invite me out to eat, introduce me to their circle, and I get just enough socializing that suits me. It‚Äôs how I‚Äôve stayed grounded. I've met lifelong partners, friends, family doing this. I've started businesses and investments, lost some along the way. I've been living my life on my terms for a long time now. That doesn't always mesh with others but I feel free in how I express myself and choose to live. I think the biggest lessons for me that I didn't know what would make me happy until I gave myself the space to test it. And this lifestyle gave me that space.

Try not to get wound up by traffic or people cutting you off in public. \\* Go out before 10am or after 5-6pm, for an hour or two, and enjoy the environment. The beaches are less crowded and it's a nicer temperature to be out anyway. \\* The sea warms up considerably from June onwards. September is ideal - it's starting to cool down but the sea is still warm. \\* Get a box fan if you don't have A/C. \\* Work during the middle of the day (hottest part) if you can. \\* Keep hydrated. \\* Eat ftira for breakfast. Even though it's a lot more expensive than it used to be, you can still get a really nice one for ‚Ç¨3,50 or so (example: Xufi in Mosta) which is a big breakfast or a split breakfast and early lunch. \\* Eat pastizzi for snacks. 2 or 3 of them at 50c a pop is good. \\* Find areas that do have trees and go hang out in them. \\* Go and check out the history: the megalithic templates are epic, the cart ruts are mind blowing, the hypogeum is a must if you can find a booking. \\* Go have a beer in the evening at a local bar and chat to some people. \\* Avoid Sliema, St Julians, Gzira. They're modern and whatever but they aren't really Malta. If you're staying in one of those areas, replace \"avoid\" with \"leave\" and go explore other places. \\* Go to Gozo.

The cost of living is so affordable. The people are generous, kind, and welcoming. It's very easy to make friends and date. And there's plenty of adventure to be had. When I was there, I drove a motorbike across the beautiful island of Palawan. I went up into the mountains to get a tattoo from Apo Wang Od in Buscalan. I also visited one of the most notorious slums called \"Happy Land\" where the people were *even more kind and welcoming*. You'll find your own adventures as well. And your story is exactly what I talk about with people. The west is so hyper-expensive, socially isolating and cold. It's miserable and depressing for so many people. People complain about the cost of moving while I complain about the cost of staying. With some budgeting and very minor sacrifices, you can literally live off of $1000 a month or less. Hell, in places like Laos, you can live off of $300/month if you're fine with living a far more simple life. To everyone looking at this as a potential lifestyle: Pay off your debts ASAP.

{"id": "mwkwa2u", "title": "Comment on: Singapore Malays and Malaysia Malay share their experiences in their own Countries...", "content": "Millennial Chinese Malaysian who used to work in Singapore here. With excellent command of Bahasa Melayu, it was easy to make friends with the Malay Singaporeans especially the older generation. I had a wonderful time there. I give the benefit of doubt, perhaps the editors cut the video and gave the wrong context. I‚Äôd like to clarify: 1. Primary and Secondary Education in Malaysia is NOT FREE but heavily subsidised for all citizens regardless of race. Since when is it free for anyone? Even the Malays pay the same annual fee as far as I can remember during my days in the 90‚Äôs. It‚Äôs about RM100-200 now (it used to be between 50-80 during my days) and the notice is sent by PIBG/PTA. 2. University quota is supposed to have been abolished but in reality, sadly the practice continues. I bumped into my Malay ex-schoolmate in a university and even he expressed how pissed off he was when he found out some of his classmates entered medicine with only MUET Band 2 while he (being among the top students I always remembered) worked so hard for a Band 6! 3. Cheaper price for Malay homes, yes but are very limited, only for specific units and NEVER going to be corner lot. Many Malays if they can help it, actually avoid going for bumi lots because it will be difficult to sell them later due to restrictions. Free land to build homes? If I‚Äôm not mistaken it was only one off during Tun Abdul Razak‚Äôs time, and it‚Äôs targeted. One example is FELDA, which requires those in the program (Peneroka FELDA) to actually work in agriculture. Sorry, no free lunches there. Nowadays? I haven‚Äôt heard of Malays being given free land for the longest time. Try to get grant for agriculture also damn hard unless you‚Äôre willing to offer huge sums of ahem ahem (under table moolah) to some low level pegawai. 4. Chinese and Indians try to avoid government service mainly because we want faster salary and career growth and flexibility, instead of being restricted to one single field for the rest of your life. Yes the perception of racial preference is still there but it‚Äôs not the main factor. As a son to 2 retired Chinese teachers who are earning at the top of the service and command respect in the community including the Malay kampung where she taught, ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù is not really a thing. And no, you don‚Äôt need to be brilliant to enter government sector. Matching your peers is good enough. 5. Royalty of course cannot be Chinese or Indian. Our ancestors immigrated here (I think she got mixed up, she wanted to refer to the Prime Minister job instead). The rulers are Malays and so will the descendants that eventually take over. Will the British royalty be Chinese or Indian one day despite their growing influence and wealth there? Did the Chinese had an emperor who was not Chinese at one point in history? Haiyo. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 6. Ok lah for Singapore, in terms of national policies, there are programmes and laws to help protect the minorities. A few Chinese locals have also been prosecuted and fined for ridiculing the Malays there (void deck weddings, Chinese student‚Äôs racial remarks on the Malays in 2012 iirc, and recently Ngee Ann Polytechnic sacked a lecturer Mr Tan Boon Lee for racial remarks). The issue is just that many local private businesses indirectly practice discrimination by asking for mandarin language competency suddenly even when it‚Äôs not listed in the job description or the company does not do business with China. Me, with near zero command of Chinese (banana here) was never asked that question (nor was I tested) in job interviews in SG. Another rant among the Malay Singaporeans is that Singapore is reluctant to give sensitive military positions to the Malays, which is actually reasonable if you know why. Ref: Lastly, as a Chinese, when I went to Singapore, I finally understood what it feels like to be the majority. The sense of entitlement is real. And yes, my Malay Singaporean friends can actually understand how we Chinese Malaysians feel in Malaysia because they can somewhat relate.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l5bb6e", "score": 24, "created_date": "2025-06-08T00:44:28+00:00", "author": "SouthernCrow5442", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1l5bb6e/singapore_malays_and_malaysia_malay_share_their/mwkwa2u/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 4019, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:36:30.261683+00:00"}

{"id": "mvkct90", "title": "Comment on: The untold story of Singapore‚Äôs exit from Malaysia...", "content": "This is what I gather from the situation, with context of the secret negotiations: At the very beginning Singapore wanted to be part of Malaysia. Evidently, Singapore has major geographical problems, anyone at the time expected Singapore becoming part of Malaysia. Even Malayans supported the idea. Negotiations of integration with Singapore and North Borneo bore fruit, resulting in Malaysia. It wasn't all smooth but at the time, they figured the details could've been furnished later on with civil \"top down\" negotiations. But when they got into that process, Singapore and Malaya got into some disputes, mainly economic policy. Then, around the same time, racial demographic issues began cropping up and it got real ugly. The two elements came together and things started going out of hand as the PAP and UMNO began openly antagonizing one another during election season. Young UMNO ultranationalists began agitating the public, sending racial issues into overdrive. From what I can understand, the rhetoric called for the PAP to be kept out of Malayan politics and acceptance of federal economic demands. PAP basically refused and that turned into a mess of people asking for Singapore's expulsion or subjugation. Tunku and LKY were under immense pressure. Tunku was in a particularly bad position as the younger UMNO ultras were steadily gaining influence. Tunku had to give them something they wanted whilst not permanently damaging relations with Singapore, or worse, ruling with an iron fist. LKY was in a similar situation. The federal economic measures were considered unacceptable by Singaporeans and there was no way for them to stay in the federation without acquiescing to it. Racial threats had also convinced many that there was no way unity was possible. Both sides decided to negotiate a divorce, but these proceedings were kept secret to ensure full control over the narrative and prevent dissenters within the federal government from seizing control and ruling via the ISA. The narrative was that Malaysia ejected Singapore, which made Tunku look strong to ultranationalists and LKY a victim of a seemingly unilateral divorce. Imho, Tunku and LKY were actually into the union but things got too heated as economic divisions spiralled into racial conflicts that nobody wanted. And the demographic situation was unsolvable aside from division.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l1dkv6", "score": 130, "created_date": "2025-06-02T10:28:57+00:00", "author": "silverking12345", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1l1dkv6/the_untold_story_of_singapores_exit_from_malaysia/mvkct90/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 2362, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:36:33.438888+00:00"}

You can expect JIPS to reach out to you. 2. You lodge a police report against the errant police personnel. This automatically gets forwarded to JIPS. I would do this only if JIPS does not respond within 30 days. 3. If all else fails, and you really want to pursue it further, bring your Sispaa and police report to a lawyer for advice.

{"id": "muk0ode", "title": "Comment on: Should I move back to Malaysia. Advice needed....", "content": "I left Canada after decades there since my early teens and ended up in KL just before the lockdowns. What was supposed to be a 3 week visit has turned out to be a homecoming I wasn't expecting. Although I hadn't lived in Malaysia previously, I've never felt more at home. So I'll try to be as blunt as I can to a fellow countryman. Politically and culturally speaking, I've watched Canada slide downhill for years even as early as 2009. And by 2014, everything I saw going sideways, did, and I planned my exit accordingly. Even since I've left, the cost of living and crime rates are up significantly and the quality of life has diminished considerably. Canada is still a fantastic country to live in if you're making 6 figures and up after taxes. So if your career or skillsets points you in that trajectory, you may still have something to look forward to. Anything less however, and it's going to be a day to day grind for you until you retire. Yes, there's free healthcare (if and when they can see you) and an amazing country to explore coast to coast. Hockey is a better sport to enjoy and cultural diversity is celebrated, although it doesn't void the fact that racism and being a minority will still affect you. Most of my friends back home have visited KL and this region and are slowly planning their exit as well. 2 have already moved to SEA, 2 more are moving in the next year, and at least another 4-5 are planning to over the next few years. The exodus is real. Even for you, if family and quality of life are important to you, Malaysia might be a better option. Time with aging parents is everyone's enemy. The only caveat I would add is that you figure out how to translate your skillsets into paying you CAD, USD, EURO, BTC etc. But even in the worst case scenario, surviving in Malaysia is infinitely easier than surviving in Canada. I hope you figure out what works best for you and I wish you well in your journey.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kwr6ks", "score": 50, "created_date": "2025-05-27T18:00:34+00:00", "author": "blingless8", "subreddit": "malaysia", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/1kwr6ks/should_i_move_back_to_malaysia_advice_needed/muk0ode/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1934, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:36:43.973117+00:00"}

{"id": "mulmpcg", "title": "Comment on: Should I move back to Malaysia. Advice needed....", "content": "Malaysian here in New Zealand. I understand where you are coming from as I have experienced this myself, but honestly, it sounds more like homesickness than anything else. Sounds cliche, but no matter how \"introvert\" people tend to claim, we as humans all need a social life. We want to \"belong\" to a tribe. Pick up hobbies, sports, or causes where you have the chance to meet people and make connections. I once lived in a small town with only around 8000 people in the middle of the South Island for a year. The nearest \"big city\" was Dunedin which was 2h 30m away so this is way smaller than Winnipeg. Admittedly I have my girlfriend & Malaysian working holiday friends, but I also made a real effort to social activities like running and hiking clubs, book clubs, hobby workshops, talk groups, book clubs, anything. I also made a concious effort to befriend my colleagues outside of work, and connect with the Malaysian group which hosts events in the nearby bigger town. That group was very tight knit and welcoming. I have moved to Auckland. It's the biggest city in NZ, but still quite small by global standards (it's only slightly bigger than Calgary). But ever since that small town, I have made it a point to put myself out there, talk to people, and be social. I work in automotive retail, and over time, even some of my customers have even become good friends. I go to an urbanists' meetup which is a networking opportunity. Don't know how social your workplace is but your company/organisation will probably have work lunches etc. Put yourself out there and befriend work colleagues. Small talk is essential in most of the Anglosphere. If that's your thing, joining a religious group can help too. I go to church, but it could be anything that aligns with your beliefs. Canada is just as multicultural as New Zealand, so you will likely find a space that suits you. The gym is good for your health, but it is not the most social place in my experience. You might want to join a more interactive setting like a kickboxing gym or group fitness classes, or yoga/pilates especially if you're female. I also volunteer with an organisation that does anti AIDS and STI awareness work when I have time. And I play futsal regularly with a bunch of mostly Malaysians. It could be any sport, so long as its social. Staying in touch with loved ones overseas is easier than ever. With video calls, you are only a few taps away. Time differences can be tricky, but it just takes some effort. I know some immigrants who call home every single day. There is even a running joke about Indian Uber drivers always being on the phone with their wives in India. You do not have to go that far, but even a weekly call can go a long way. I'm not sure if you have an SO but it would be great to do that too. A good SO goes a long way. Of course being single is better than a toxic relationship, but a good relationship is way better than being single. This was my experience. You are probably in a better position than I was. I was born, raised, and schooled in the exact same neighbourhood in KL. Even in uni I stayed home. Most of my friends were from school. From what you have written, it sounds like you do not have much of a social circle outside your family. That can be tough, but it also means you have a blank slate to build your own community. It takes time, but it is worth it.

That's super great. But you're right - realistically that might he tough with the current rules, but let's see how far you can get with it, considering you have a PR and that. Back to your predicament. Should you go back? Yes and no. Look, there's nothing like family, and sounds like you have a good one too since you want to be close to them. I get the homesickness and loneliness - especially living in a foreign land far away, and one that comes with brutal winter too. No amount of money can replace them in that sense and let's be honest, they're not getting any younger (but a large amount can definitely bring them closer; you can afford to fly them over more often). Start with this - don't jump the gun, yet. With your current salary you'll need to find a place that pays RM13K net, so a gross of close to RM17-18k - with 3 YoE realistically you're not getting that - probably RM4-5k. Tops. So if you want to go back, see if the financials make sense, you'll probably be living with your parents again so not an issue in saving up etc. Also what's your financial goal? Save up in general? Buy a house? Those will determine how much money you \"want\". Otherwise with a 4k salary it will be a longg slog to save for say - a house. Additionally see what's the going market rate for your field and decide from there. Best to stay at the moment, and push ahead with your dreams to bring them here.

Ts. Dr. Mohd Ghazali bin Abdul Rahman iaitu Dron First Person View (FPV) RPG-7 yang diberi nama Army Kamikaze Dron. Dron ini direka untuk membawa kepala peledak RPG yang dipasang pada dron, membolehkannya terbang secara autonomi atau dikawal dari jauh untuk menyerang sasaran dengan tepat. Aspek paling menarik tentang projek ini adalah gabungan antara pelancar roket RPG-7 yang merupakan senjata ikonik dalam inventori TD dan dron FPV. Gabungan kedua-dua elemen ini menghasilkan sistem serangan yang lebih fleksibel dan berkesan. Ianya turut mencerminkan warga TD mengambil langkah proaktif kepada arus perkembangan konflik global menggunakan teknologi terkini. Penglibatan dron FPV RPG-7 dalam LIMA‚Äô25 ini menandakan satu langkah penting dalam transformasi TDM ke arah penggunaan teknologi tinggi dalam operasi ketenteraan. Dengan menggabungkan kepakaran tempatan dan inovasi teknologi, TDM menunjukkan komitmennya untuk terus maju da≈Çam menghadapi cabaran peperangan moden.

Singapore --> flew to Langkawi --> combo ferry x grab to station x commuter train x grab to hotel (sounds like a lot but was cheap and actually very comfortable/straightforward) to Penang --> high speed rail to KL --> flight back to Singapore. My take was KL was really fun to explore and worth spending time in. We did a number of tours to learn more about the history, spent time wandering Chinatown, etc. We ran out of time to do everything there because things are a bit spread out and it can take a while with traffic to get to different parts of the city. I was talked out of Cameroon highlands and Malacca for the same reasons (if you've been, I also found Hoi An too touristy so depends on what you like). I don't regret spending more time in KL. Personally, I would skip Malacca and spend more time in KL, and if you can afford to in Singapore (those hotel prices are no joke...at least for my budget!). There was a whole half of the island/hiking/eco walks we just ran out of time for. The only other thing I would do if I had more time was the Perhentian islands on the east coast...if you're looking for great snorkeling/swimming this could be a swap out but you'd need to fly in.

Near the Thai Malay border on the Thai side there‚Äôs a few provinces that are kinda dangerous not recommended for travel, it‚Äôs fine tho if u travel near the west coast across the Thai Malay border. The only other dodgy area is the islands off north east Borneo have a kidnapping risk that area is not recommended. Safety wise the scams are pretty similar to like every other country, some random ones, taxi/ tuktuk drivers telling u a place is closed when it‚Äôs not and taking u to a different place for a lot of money, scams with renting equipment and being told u caused damage when u didn‚Äôt, just stuff being overpriced, like taxis use grab or negotiate the price. Other risks are food safety so be careful with what you eat and also the traffic can be quite crazy be careful 4. U will struggle like a lot just in terms of labelling of allergens in places not being very common. Google to death 10 gluten free restaurants for every destination u end up in or cook in ur accommodation. Relying on random people with cards saying you have an allergy to not put wheat in the food would be quite risky you would probably get ill at least once but u can try that 7. U don‚Äôt need any vaccinations as just a standard tourist wandering round the regular tourist route just bug spray and also endless suncream 11. There isn‚Äôt a month worth of things to do in Cambodia but u can also go to Laos which is a very interesting country, or just book a flight outside of south east Asia if u feel like it to Hong Kong China Taiwan depends what ur nationality allows easily passport wise tbh", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1lfm2fw", "score": 1, "created_date": "2025-06-19T22:56:19+00:00", "author": "turtledude100", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lfm2fw/tips_on_traveling_to_asia_vietnam_thailand/mypraqt/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1627, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:37:14.348380+00:00"}

{"id": "mxc0nna", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia ‚Äì advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "Malaysian here, hope you find these answers helpful. 1. Is the Sabah region safe? Generally safe. You'll find some travel advisories regarding the east coast of Sabah which used to be targeted for pirate kidnappings. Authorities have kept it under control recently but something to keep in mind. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? Lots to do in Sabah such as the Sepilok Orangutan reserve, Kota Kinabalu town, Mabul & Sipadan islands for diving, Mount Kinabalu for hiking. The problem is transportation between them which I'll get to later. 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? It seems you are going for a nature themed trip which will generally be more authentic than going to urban areas. 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? It is difficult to get around the areas of your interest, East Peninsula and especially Sabah. There are no trains or public transport. Roads are very bad in Sabah. Your best bet would be buses but those are operated by private companies and you'll want to vet through carefully to make sure they are legit. Driving or motorbike on your own at your own risk, as mentioned the roads are bad. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? I would suggest you consider Sarawak. It is more developed than Sabah but also offers a lot in terms of nature, though mostly forest based vs island based. Would be much easier to arrange transport around Sarawak. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Redang Island is a boat ride from Perhentian. Tioman is further but also noteworthy. On the mainland there are the towns of Kuala Terengganu and Kuantan. Lake Kenyir also for an inland forest reserve. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? For just a day, I'd recommend staying near the airport. Not much to do in just a day in KL and it is quite a distance from the airport. The airport train is convenient though expensive, might want to see if you feel it is worthwhile to stay in the city based on that.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9e0es", "score": 4, "created_date": "2025-06-12T05:34:27+00:00", "author": "FireTempest", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1l9e0es/malaysia_advice_on_borneo_and_east_coast/mxc0nna/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 2130, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:37:18.773641+00:00"}

There are farms like Strawberries and Tea plantations if you are into that sort of thing. Be warned though - the travel there can be quite risky depending on the weather. * Genting Highlands: Casinos and Theme Park. Can also enjoy the colder weather. * Ipoh: In my opinion, quite similar to Malacca in terms of vibes. The food is also good. * Sabah & Perhentian would require a flight. Cheaper flights can be found, but I would suggest at least a 4-day trip if you are planning on going to those states. For jet-skiing or parasailing, I would suggest Langkawi Island, if that is not feasible during this trip, then Penang or Port Dickson might be a closer option.

You didn't mention the kind of vacation you're into (cultural, relaxing, outdoorsy, foodie, shopping, etc.) so these are just some suggestions which I will leave to you and your partner to consider: 1. If this is your first time to Singapore, you may want to extend your stay there or skip it for another time. 3D/2N in Singapore feels rather short if it's your first time there as there is quite a lot to do and see there. 2. If you choose to skip Singapore, you could consider spending a couple of days in Melaka. 3D/2N would be just nice. If you're into history and culture it's a nice place to visit. 3. Since you have 6D in KL, you can do day trips from KL to places like Melaka (if you did not do #2 above), Ipoh (food and culture), Kuala Selangor/Sekinchan (paddy fields, fireflies) or Genting Highlands (cooler temperatures, theme park, shopping). There are tours available on Klook that you can book. 4. You can cut down 1 trip to the airport if you rearrange your itinerary to London > Singapore > Langkawi > Penang > KL. There are buses available from Penang to KL. Or you can also take the train by first taking the ferry from Penang island to the mainland and then walking to the Butterworth train station. 5. Domestic airports in Malaysia are quite small. Arriving 1.5 hours before your flight is sufficient as I assume you will have luggage to check in.

Staying in hostels, eating a mix of street food and cheap restaurants, taking cheapest transport options and skipping the most expensive activities, then your budget is doable. What will really screw you is alcohol. It can be cheap to drink a lot of places, but you can easily drink an entire day's budget away without realising it. If you are a drinker then you will likely be tempted to drink every night, so if you want your trip to last the full 4 months then you would need to take it easy and have many nights off. Consider whether it is worth shortening your trip so you can do more expensive activities. For example, an extra month spent not really doing much because you can't afford it, compared to taking that money and using it towards memorable experiences (Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, scuba diving, Angkor Wat, Ha Giang Loop, etc) to me is so worth it.

{"id": "my91icz", "title": "Comment on: What is the best plattform to book hotels in Asia?...", "content": "In general, the issue you're running into of fake reviews is unavoidable especially in SEA. In general I assume most places will have many fake reviews. Booking direct wouldn't really change the outcome Vs an aggregator if it's simply a bad hotel, although it is often cheaper and useful when it comes to flexibility and customer service at good places. Short of staying in massive international chains that care about their reputation (Hilton, Marriott etc.) and paying the premium for it, the only way to know what a place is going to be like is an extremely careful review of reviews. This means: - Focusing on the 1 & 2 stars and understand the difference between mismatched expectations and bad hotels. A complaint about a 1 star hotel not having ice at 2am or the lack of a chauffeur is not valid Vs bed bugs, being robbed and cockroaches - Reading deep into the profile of recent reviewers Considering, is all this profile does is review hotels in KL despite claiming to be from Germany, or are the majority of their reviews for cafes and restaurants in rural Brandenburg? - Cross checking multiple review sites - I always look at booking but often don't book through them, it's worthwhile to check a few review sites - Cross check with online SM travel content (and again interrogate them thorough for genuine content) as they will often have videos of rooms which can be useful for an overall vibe, but you never know if a place has 10 good rooms and 90 terrible rooms. - Consider the number of reviews - for big cities anywhere with less than a hundred I don't even glance at, but generally I will only stay at places with 500+. Adjust this expectation for more rural and smaller places where the guests throughout will be lower. - Consider if the deal is too good to be true. If it's a significant % cheaper than the others then think really hard about why it's that price.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1ldlako", "score": 5, "created_date": "2025-06-17T12:18:03+00:00", "author": "Fusilero", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ldlako/what_is_the_best_plattform_to_book_hotels_in_asia/my91icz/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1884, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:37:38.690941+00:00"}

{"id": "my9gv18", "title": "Comment on: What is the best plattform to book hotels in Asia?...", "content": "I prefer to book direct with the hotel whenever possible as they‚Äôre much more likely to upgrade you and look after you as they‚Äôre not having to fund an aggregator who takes like 30% of the fee. We actually booked a hotel a while back with Agoda and my buddy had a super loud and rattling air conditioner in his room. He went to reception to ask if he could swap to a quieter room and their response was no you booked with Agoda, that‚Äôs the room you get. We stopped buying through aggregators (mostly) after that. I‚Äôve been buying an Accor Plus membership for the past couple of years and the accommodation savings are really good along with the food/drink discounts from their restaurants. It‚Äôs a smart arrangement where they give you additional discounts/perks for your brand loyalty, plus the usual earning of points that you can swap for numerous discount programs. The annual membership fee goes on a discounted sale frequently, and for your fee you get 1 free night accommodation, immediate bump to silver status which I believe gives you an additional discount on your room, a welcome drink, and late checkout if available. Gold which requires 10 nights of stay on top of your immediate silver qualification gives even more benefits with your choice of early check-in or late checkout and a room category upgrade - both if available. All this being said, I‚Äôm not sure what type of accommodation you typically book. Accor focuses more on the middle of the pack/upmarket accommodation vs super cheap sketchy accommodation. If you‚Äôre typically booking the latter, then Accor isn‚Äôt the right choice for you.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1ldlako", "score": 2, "created_date": "2025-06-17T13:47:26+00:00", "author": "nathlovesreddit", "subreddit": "travel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ldlako/what_is_the_best_plattform_to_book_hotels_in_asia/my9gv18/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1609, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:37:38.694944+00:00"}

{"id": "mvuz0ug", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia, 3 weeks, tips and itinerary...", "content": "I was just there in March. I really loved Borneo and wish I allocated more time. Did not care for Taman Negara. Liked the Cameron Highlands a lot (just don't go on the weekends). Taman Negara was perhaps the biggest disappointment. I had 2 nights there, and by the morning after the first, I was plotting how I could cut out early to the next destination. Here's the thing about Taman Negara... the canopy walk has been closed for a while now, and will probably remain that way for a while. Other than that, a lot of the treks are similar, and you won't see much wildlife. The night tour was OK, but this is definitely not off the beaten path. If you want to leave the crowds behind, you have to commit yourself to a guided (i.e., pricey), uncomfortable, leach-filled, overnight trek. Cameron Highlands pleasantly surprised me. Yes, it's built up. Yes, it's touristy. But the scenery is spectacular, and there are multiple trekking opportunities. Keep in mind, the estimated times you see are grossly underestimated. In spite of the fact that development is encroaching on the trails, some of them are true jungle treks -muddy, difficult, and extremely steep (as in, more of a climb than a trek). Borneo is where you can really leave the crowds behind, and find those clean seas and crowd-free jungle treks where you can actually see animals. Mind you, I barely scratched the surface. But I'll say this, even a day trip to Bako National Park is extremely worth-while, where you'll have an excellent chance to see bearded pigs, proboscis monkeys, and of course spectacular scenery. Overnight is even better. I did Mt. Kinabalu, including the highest via ferrata in the world, and that was without a doubt one of the highlights (if not the highlight) of the trip. But very expensive. Did not even get to other spectacular scenery like Gunung Mulu NP. Kuching is a great town to base yourself in Borneo. Nearby you'll have access to national parks, a sanctuary of semi-wild orangutans, several local villages, and a delightful waterfront that serves as a promenade for locals. I haven't mentioned the cities so much, because you seem to not like cities as much. But I really liked the canopy walk on Penang Hill. Not crowded at all when I went, but it was a weekday on Ramadan, so YMMV.

I got my teeth cleaned in Kuala Lumpur. That was fun! (not). Try a blind massage! I had one and wish I had booked the 90 minutes! 3. I thought Malacca was going to be a tourist trap, so I did a day trip and booked a walking tour. I really enjoyed it and felt I could've spent a full-day/night there. It's historic and worth at least a day trip from KL. 4. One of my life's regrets is not making it to Borneo, so can't comment. 5. WiFi in general was FANTASTIC! (Not the case in Indonesia, FYI) 6. Book train tickets WAY in advance because it does sell out. I got stuck on an awful bus going from Penang to KL. Horrible experience and the driver almost left me behind!

{"id": "mxby7nc", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia ‚Äì advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "I spent almost all of my two-week Malaysia trip in Borneo! The Sabah travel advisories mostly focus on specific islands off the east coast of Sabah where there have been some security incidents in the past targeting tourists. So if in doubt you could avoid those islands. The Sabah portion of my trip was spent in Sandakan (as a base for a tour of Kinabatangan River area) and Kota Kinabalu (as a stopover before heading to Mulu National Park). Sandakan and KK are kind of odd cities in and of themselves but they don't feel particularly touristy, at least not the areas I stayed in. For seeing the Kinabatangan River area (and/or nearby-ish Danum Valley) you pretty much need to join a guided tour group since these areas are somewhat remote/wild, and the guides can find the wildlife. I saw three wild orangutans! Getting around in Borneo can be a bit impractical. On a tight schedule domestic flights unfortunately are the most reasonable option, or sometimes the *only* option. From Kota Kinabalu you could hike Mount Kinabalu if you want to. I'd have done that if I had more time. It sounds kinda intense though and is an overnight commitment. But if you like hiking it sounds probably worth it! I think there are some islands near-ish KK that you could visit and they're I think pretty far from any of the islands covered under some of the eastern Sabah travel advisories. If you add anything else to a Borneo itinerary, it might be worth considering Mulu National Park - it's more conventionally \"touristy\" in some ways but the massive caves there are unlike anything I've seen anywhere else. Deer Cave is, I think by most measures, the largest cave in the world. I stayed a night in KL after arriving and was glad I did. For a major city I thought it had a kind of relaxing \"vibe\" and great food, and I was grateful to not need to immediately get on another plane after arriving in the country.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l9dzgl", "score": 10, "created_date": "2025-06-12T05:13:26+00:00", "author": "WalkingEars", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l9dzgl/malaysia_advice_on_borneo_and_east_coast/mxby7nc/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1902, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:37:52.427293+00:00"}
{"id": "mxgd31i", "title": "Comment on: Malaysia ‚Äì advice on Borneo and east coast...", "content": "1. Is the Sabah region safe? There are some tourist areas within areas with poorer folk, but like any other tourist place just exercise caution with beggars and pickpockets. But it is generally safe. If you aare referring to terrorist activities, this was around 10 years ago and there hasn't been tourist related threats since. Although you'll still see some armed personnel on beaches and islands here and there. But overall it's generally safe for tourists. 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5‚Äì7 days? From Kota Kinabalu, go to Mt Kinabalu. It is incredibly expensive to do the 2D1N climb up due to quotas but you can still do a day trip hike around the base of the mountain from Kota Kinabalu. Alternatively you can also stay in the nearby Kundasang area (beautiful views) but it is difficult to get around without a car. From there you have some alternatives. Alternative 1 - Fly or take the bus to Sandakan. Do the 3D/2N or 4D/3N Kinabatangan cruise + Sepilok orang utan centre. Sightings of wildlife at Kinabatangan are not guaranteed so most people do 3D2N but you can still absolutely do a 2D1N trip. Then you can try to squeeze in the second alternative if you'd like. Alternative 2 - Fly or take the bus to Tawau. Then take the van to Semporna. Do the 3D2N or 4D3N island hopping hikes and dives. The main attraction is Sipadan but just like Mt Kinabalu, it is also expensive to do it due to quotas. However there are many other islands and dive spots around that are just as gorgeous. You can fly from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. 3. it too touristy or still authentic? Yes there are lots of tourists especially Chinese, Japanese and Koreans. But it's popular because it's gorgeous (and is a known vacation spot for East Asian celebrities). 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? Grab is a ride hailing app that is used everywhere. Taxis are overpriced if you try to haggle in person but they are also on Grab and prices are more transparent there. Do not attempt to haggle with a Malaysian taxi driver, they can get aggressive. Bike and car rentals are available everywhere. There are no motorbike taxis in Malaysia. For buses, download the Easybook or Redbus app. They are mostly used in Malaysia and prices are the same as in the bus stations unlike 12goasia. 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? If you have just 1 week, stick to Sabah. If you have 2 weeks, you can do Sarawak as well. If you have 3-4 weeks, then you can consider Kalimantan. I've backpacked the entire island by land except when entering Brunei, feel free to ask me anything. You might want to check out the relevant subreddits r/Sarawak and r/Sabah. 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? Pulau Tioman and Pulau Redang are also popular but you won't have time to fit this in your current itinerary. 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately? If you've never been, KL is a cool place to check out for the night, especially if you love skyscrapers. KLCC Twin towers have a nice park (and are an icon of Malaysia) and the TRX is a magnificent tower. The food in Kuala Lumpur is also underrated compared to neighbouring capital cities. If you're not a fan of big cities and malls, definitely skip.

Sydney winter (if you are visiting around July) is not the best. Most attractions are beach based. NZ is beautiful in winter if you ski but can get tricky with ice on roads.

They're not bad, don't get me wrong, but end of the day both are essentially big cities without standout tourist attractions (like say the monuments in Paris / Rome). If you're in the area and have some extra days or you live in the region, sure, but not really highest priority for the area imo. If it's your first time in SE Asia, I'd probably just go with the main attractions - something in Thailand or Vietnam, maybe w/ bus trips (you'd certainly have the time) to Cambodia or Laos. Or as you're doing Taiwan anyway, there's Japan, China, and SK. Depends on what you want to do - SG & KL are perfectly fine, I just wouldn't rank them at the top.

To be completely frank, China is a bit more challenging as a travel destination - language barrier aside, the Great Firewall means you likely need to download a couple extra apps so you're ready for it. VPN if you want to access your normal sites (Google sites, etc.), local apps (a local maps and translator app because Google apps won't work, Didi (Uber equivalent), figure out WeChat and WeChat / AliPay for local payments, etc.).

A week in El Nido is a long time. From memory there are 3 (or 4?) day trips from El Nido to do island hopping. There are some nice beaches in the surrounding area, but a week is too long. Do some research on this. Bohol for a week is also a long time. After 4 or 5 nights you would be wanting out. I would research this whole thing more. Others have posted about a trip from Coron to El Nido boat trip that is recommended, if you are in to that. You can also fly direct from El Nido to Boracay (Caticlan). Truly one of the best beaches in the world and while it is full of tourists, walk down the beach to the end of Station 3 and you can have the beach mostly to yourself. From there you can fly to Bohol. Christmas time in the Philippines is a peak travel time, so you will need to book flights and accommodation, but expect tourist places to be overflowing with crowds. You could steal some time from Vientiane as it is just a city and four full days there is not as much fun, compared to VV and Luang Prabang. Getting a flight that involves a transfer in Manila, rather than having to actually stay in Manila would be recommended. If you can fly into the Philippines and change planes to get to Coron, for example, is worth the extra dollars to avoid Manila traffic, taxis and hassles.", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1kx0c10", "score": 2, "created_date": "2025-05-28T09:13:00+00:00", "author": "3rd_in_line", "subreddit": "solotravel", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kx0c10/help_with_itinerary/muo3c1j/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1662, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:38:07.148677+00:00"}

A war could break out, a natural disaster could occur, places might become more attractive or less attractive destinations for you for a number of reasons. In terms of finding decent accommodations, checking a few days in advance is usually enough. Also in terms of researching where to go, public transport logistics, etc. And not having everything set in stone beforehand also allows you to change your mind along the way. If you really want to spend time planning, Maybe spend some checking things like seasonal peculiarities in some of those places, such as what time in the year it makes sense to go to Japan (spoiler: it's either spring or autumn), what traditional festivals that you could witness will take place where and when, etc. PS: Some of the places you've mentioned I would include along the most overrated, overcrowded touristic destinations in the world, like Ko Phi Phi for example, or Canggu (in fact, much of Bali).", "content_type": "comment", "parent_post_id": "1l2a0oa", "score": 3, "created_date": "2025-06-03T15:13:42+00:00", "author": "jvjjjvvv", "subreddit": "backpacking", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1l2a0oa/how_do_people_plan_these_things/mvs7cqq/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1062, "is_stickied": false, "parent_comment_id": null, "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-23T08:38:18.013750+00:00"}

Thailand is the perfect place to \"learn\" how to travel, then continuing on the Banana Pancake Trail through Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam is really easy too. Finishing with Indonesia and Malaysia is very simple and straightforward. You're now ready to move to South Asia and do Sri Lanka and India. By this time you'll be experienced enough to handle your first ambitious country - India - with no problems. Also, India has great flight connections to Europe then onward to Latin America. Small point, it's Col**o**mbia. Lastly regarding your itinerary and choice of countries... It's great that you've done this research and prep. So many first timers come to travel forums and expect everyone to turn in their private Travel Agent and plan everything for them. Kudos to you. You've put together quite an itinerary and it's a fantastic guide/template to start your trip. That said, I think you should be prepared to throw much of your plan into the trash bin. The best thing *by far* about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. 1.) There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... 2.) There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... 3.) And most importantly there will be places you've never even considered that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out... **Bottom line:** Make use of this wonderful opportunity and be open to at least *some* spontaneity. Be prepared to venture away from the usual tourist centres every now and then. And very importantly be prepared to slow down a little and not be so worried/fixated about checking boxes. Good luck.

Secondly, the Malaysian government approved only 2,000 digital nomad visas between 2022 and 2024 (out of 4,000 applications). \\[1\\] That implies 1,000 digital nomads a year.

Sure, there are groceries on site, but it's going to be Chinese-oriented, which isn't going to appeal to every digital nomad.

These metrics aren't linear, so just because x1 QOL has y1 COL, that doesn't mean x4 QOL has y4 COL. For bare minimum COL, you can be right, maybe Central Asia, but parts of that may have worse QOL. But that ratio can change depending on what aspects of QOL you're unwilling to give up. Like Thailand can have REALLY cheap food, but a lot of that REALLY cheap food (while quite delicious) is not particularly high quality/healthy. Then to get high quality healthy dining out or groceries, the price goes up very quickly, to where somewhere like Korea can be cheaper for that quality, since it's actually pretty hard to find anywhere with quality near as low as Thailands cheap food (and rarely costs as little), but then good quality food is very competitively priced.

Now let's start with internet, if you are in the cities like Dar_es_salaam, Moshi or Arusha it's easier to get good quality internet from providers like TTCL and habari node which you'll need to speed from 25 dollars -50dollars a month depending on your needs. Otherwise you can just get yourself a router and a SIM card from your service provider of choice. Transport depends really on the place you live, Dar_es_salaam people normally use bolt and Uber to get by because it's highly populated but Moshi has the most structured transport system with the bajaji(tuk-tuk) being available in every street making it easy to get by. Now, there is a bit of power outage especially when it's dry season but not everywhere and not everytime, some neighborhoods experience little or no outage. Otherwise all the other cons can be mitigated and this perhaps is the perfect place to live, retire or even start over because you can literally live a happy life with lowest income possible.
