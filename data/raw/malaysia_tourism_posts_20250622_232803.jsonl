{"id": "1lhkn95", "title": "Trip Report: Southern Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina in June 2025", "content": "We (couple M31 and M41) just returned from an 8-day road trip across southern Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and here’s an overview of our route and impressions. Split: We flew into Split, where we rented a car directly at the airport and stayed about 15 minutes by car from the centre, which was good since the city was packed. But traffic is also bad, so it’s a 50/50 trade-off. In the end, we often left the car and just took the bus into town, to avoid driving in circles while looking for overpriced parking lots. Highlights of Split: the Riva promenade and Diocletian’s Palace. The palace is a living monument, full of shops, bars, and life, although very touristy. The beaches around Split also offer clear water, and the food was consistently good. That said, the crowds in the city centre can get overwhelming. Trogir: We made a short detour to Trogir. It’s a beautiful town and great for photos, but it’s very small. We walked around for an hour, then moved on. It felt more like a tourist museum than a real city. Also very hot and busy when we visited. Hvar Island: This was hands down the highlight of our trip. We took the ferry from Split and stayed in Hvar town, which has a stylish, upscale feel. Drink prices were noticeably higher, but otherwise costs were similar to the rest of coastal Croatia. We loved the town: the port, the waterfront promenade, and especially the views from the Spanish Fortress and Fort Napoleon. We also took the car inland to see the lavender fields, definitely a must do, but bear in mind it only makes sense during the blooming season (spring and early summer). There are several swimming spots directly in town, which we really enjoyed. Then we drove across the island (which takes about 1.5 hours from end to end) to the quieter eastern side. On the ride there, we found an absolutely amazing and almost empty beach at Privokrinika, a real gem. From Sucuraj, we took the ferry to Drvenik on the mainland. Neum (Bosnia’s coastal town): From Drvenik, we drove straight into Bosnia-Herzegovina and stayed in Neum, the country’s only coastal town. The vibe here was very different: more modest tourism, mostly Bosnian families or passersby, less developed infrastructure but kinda in a good way. It was quiet (we went on a weekday), relaxed, and very affordable. We had excellent food at half the prices of Croatia. Definitely worth a stop for one night, or two if you want a proper beach day saving on food and drinks. Mostar: The drive inland from Neum to Mostar was beautiful: hillside roads in great condition with great views. Mostar didn’t disappoint. The Ottoman-style old town and the famous bridge are iconic for a reason and absolutely lived up to expectations. There are still visible signs of the war like abandoned or damaged buildings, but that also makes the place more real, especially if you’re interested in the region’s recent history. We would absolutely recommend a visit. Prices for restaurants and cafes were low by western European standards. Dubrovnik: Our final stop was Dubrovnik. Yes, it’s gorgeous, but it comes with caveats. The crowds were intense and prices were high across the board. We stayed at a hotel outside the old town, which we highly recommend especially if you're driving: parking near the centre is either non-existent or absurdly expensive. Definitely book a place with its own parking if you're coming by car. Public transport works, but isn’t smooth. No online tickets, only available from a few manned kiosks (with limited hours), or from the bus driver for a surcharge, which leads to long queues at bus stops. The old town is beautiful and the vibe is magical, but we skipped the walk on the city walls. At 40€ per person, the price felt excessive... a real shame, honestly. There are great swimming spots near the old town, though, and the view from Mount Srd (above Dubrovnik) is breathtaking. You can get there by car (if you’re a confident driver because the street up there isn't the easiest), by taxi, or via the cable car. From up there, you can see the entire walled city and the surrounding coast, definitely one of the best views of the trip. All in all, we’d highly recommend this route if you want a combination of coast, islands, and a bit of inland culture and history. Just be ready for comparably high prices and large crowds in Croatia, and in our opinion, absolutely don't miss a day or two in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

{"id": "1lhk7x7", "title": "Total Fail Travel Stories?", "content": "I’ll go first. I went to New Orleans in 2023. A budget trip if you will. I’ve never been great at saving money, so once the flight was out the way, I booked the hotel. As the months went by, I didn’t stay on my savings track to be able to pay for the hotel. So in my mind I thought “a hostel shouldn’t be too bad”. Albeit I chose private rooms in the 2 hostels I booked. Non of them were in the FQ but the map said it was a 20 minute walk from one hostel, and a 20 minute trolley from the other. Too that with the fact I hadn’t paid my phone bill and so travelled from the UK to NOLA with NO data. I I arrived at the hostel in the evening and basically walked into a live music set and as I stood at the “desk” to check in, I could literally touch the singer if I wanted. I was told that food was banned from being taken to my room, so alone, I wondered out to the dark road where nothing was happening, but I saw a Wendy’s next door and sat inside eating my crappy meal wondering what I was doing here! Trying to navigate myself to the FQ the next morning to look for Cafe Beignet was a shit show without data! I was starving and walking round in circles…. Tail between legs I went back to the hostel. Anyway I thought I’d make the most of it… after a couple of days I got into the swing of things and visited the Garden District and found a couple of pubs near the hostel that I enjoyed. After a few days I checked into my new hostel in Mid City which was pretty much a shed in the garden. It was so cold I had to sleep in practically all the clothes I’d brought on the trip. Tired, hungry, no options close by for food, or any bars in walking distance…. I had one nice evening bar hopping in the FQ but I was always aware I couldn’t stay too late as I had no data to get an Uber, so was reliant on the trolly. One evening I got off the trolley a few stops too late and was on a dark road with NO data, walking up and down trying to spot any points that would jolt my memory. I’m going back this December and am basically gonna do everything different. For one im gonna stay in a nice hotel in the FQ, two - make sure I’ve paid my fucking phone bill (oh what a luxury having data will be!) one evening I had to draw a make shift map to an Irish bar that was not far from hostel (ffs!) You get what you pay for and I’ll never cut corners again. To be able to wake up in a nice clean hotel, walk a few steps to a big tasty breakfast, use the gym, leave the hotel and walk around where everything is on my doorstep, plan my evenings out etc. Even after the shambles it was, it’s still vivid in my memory and I look at it with love (even though I wanted to cry that freezing night in the shed haha)", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1lhk7x7", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 7, "created_date": "2025-06-22T09:52:00+00:00", "author": "Rebelrebel37", "subreddit": "solotravel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lhk7x7/total_fail_travel_stories/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lhk7x7/total_fail_travel_stories/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2696, "flair": "Question", "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "hot", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:29:18.316488+00:00"}

Also, I read somewhere that 5 days for Chongqing alone might be a bit too much, so was considering whether to spend 3 days in Chongqing and 2 in Chengdu or viceversa.

The stop sign is done with your left hand, stretching it slightly left, palm faced up like this 🤚 2. In general, keep right, as left is the position for overtaking 3. When right turning, do a turn signal. Finger gun position, arm stretched out 4. Don't walk on the bikelanes 5. Don't park bikes on the bikelanes 6. Don't bike side by side with your friends, unless it's veeeery quiet 7. Don't randomly ring the bell for fun! It's the same as a car honk here. Use it if someone is doing something dangerous only 8.

Or the locks on bridge railings. The fucking hop on trains that run through the old towns. And I know I’m part of the problem. The second worst part is all the shops in these old buildings is either a candy shop, a restaurant that caters to tourists, or yeah another candy shop. Fuck everything about that. The whole place felt disnified despite the buildings themselves being authentically old. The worst part is seeing locals living upstairs opening their windows, seeing the horde of tourists, then promptly closing their windows :( Planned rothenburg next and I can’t wait to be depressed :( it’s also on me to visit these spots but also, there’s not many hotspots left of this era of medieval architecture. Even Oxford UK is overrun with tourists when I went there 2 years ago I think I’m done going to anywhere that’s remotely popular. I did a countryside biking trip in Tours to various castles and it was so utterly pleasant, to see less people and most of them are French outdoorsy types. Locals would be so happy that I went to their little spots and we would strike a convo. I hope to do more of that than the same old tired popular destination that is filled to the brim with candy shops and hordes of people.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1lc5upd", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 4, "created_date": "2025-06-15T17:26:52+00:00", "author": "Old-Tutor2672", "subreddit": "TravelNoPics", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1lc5upd/collar_riquewihr_so_beautiful_yet_so_depressing/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1lc5upd/collar_riquewihr_so_beautiful_yet_so_depressing/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1842, "flair": null, "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "hot", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:30:20.800706+00:00"}

Can only choose 2.", "content": "Planning a trip to take my mom (64) and older sister (28) to Europe for 8 full days in early September and need some advice. Currently, the one thing we’re doing for sure is Krakow to see Auschwitz. We’re deciding between: Vienna, Prague, Budapest, and maybe Amsterdam (because we’d fly out of there, I know it’s far out the way). We’d have 3.5 days in the first place, 2 in Krakow, and then 2.5 days in the last place. We’re not going for the night life obviously as this is a family trip, and I think my family gets bored of museums fairly quickly too.. I think we’re just looking for somewhere where we can walk around and see lots of beauty, eat good food in quaint(?) places, and have cool things to do like catching a show at the Vienna State Operahouse or the thermal baths in Budapest, etc. Those kinds of activities. Just not endless museums/churches, though, a cool Jewish Quarter would also be nice. I’ve gone through like 20 posts across reddit on comparing the 3, as it seems many people have had this question before, and I’m still unsure what to do as it’s been mixed. It seems like there’s a slight preference to having Budapest #1, Prague #2, and Vienna #3, with comments saying Vienna is like any quintessential European city, as if its something and nothing special at the same time. But also, I’ve read Prague and Budapest are really similar, and if that’s the case, then maybe it’d make sense to go with Vienna as it’d be different than them? People also said Prague is insanely touristy, but since we’d be there in September, hopefully some of that is missed. Amsterdam was also randomly thrown out there, but I feel like Amsterdam is more of a friend’s trip than it is a family one.

There is people all around the world that I'm \"friends\" with, people who text me often, I text people today for example but it's like, not deep deep loving friends I want to be on the phone with all the time (I am 33 so maybe it's just that time of age). Maybe some type of mid life crisis regarding friendships/relationships right now. I could go out and just start dating someone to fill that void but I'm trying to go within more. I guess I post it here as the digital no mad lifestyle can be \"lonely\" although I don't really feel lonely, I just am aware that I spend a lot of time by myself. Maybe I'll join some hobbies just to start flexing the muscle more. Anyways, I just left the sauna, going to grab some nice food and just relax.

{"id": "1lh1c8m", "title": "A Month in Buenos Aires", "content": "I did a month in BA - mid-May to mid-June. As a 40 yo DN, I came in looking to explore the city and work out of my AirBnb. Here are some thoughts to those that are interested; I'm sure others would have a different take. For me, the cons outweighed the pros but still a great city to hang out in, even as a somewhat introverted person. 1. **Productivity**: Looking at the weather ahead of time, I thought May would be an OK month to visit. It has fall weather with a high of 18 degrees Celsius most days. But with it being totally dark until 8am each morning, and then overcast for another couple hours, you really only have 4 hours of good sunlight most days. That hurt my motivation as I'm usually most productive in the morning (my ignorance). Choose a different month, depending on your preference. 2. **Social**: The DN culture here is OK (May could be a worse month than most). I went to some meet ups and went on a few dates. I'm not so much a late night person, so the 11pm dinner culture really didn't appeal to me most nights. I also found ghosting and being late to be a bit more prevalent than I have witnessed in other LATAM countries. Just my experience. 3. **City**: Extremely walkable city. I averaged about 20k steps per day. Great architecture and I felt safe at all times of the day. Staying a month, I noticed the street signage, well laid out parks and the well-organized garbage collection. It's very European, with the window shades and bidets. The subway was a $1 per trip and it is easy to use and expansive. They recently allowed credit cards to be tapped to enter. 4. **Cost**: My AirBnb was well priced (about $950 CAD for a month, a spacious 1 bedroom, fast internet) and Ubers were cheap. But going out for a drink or dinner was expensive. I found even cheap takeaway food, like a shawarma, was $12-15. A 1oz liquor drink was $15. I was surprised that at the most prevalent convenience store (Dia) you could buy a bottle of Smirnoff vodka for under $10. Imports cost far more than local products. Beef was cheap as well. 5. **Random:** 1. If you need a physical sim card, bring your passport and phone to the Alto Palermo mall (Claro store, floor 3). You can get setup with a 25GB data plan for your month for about $20. 2. There are no coins in the country. Even 10 cents will be a new bill in your pocket. My credit card gave me a decent exchange rate (but still 4-5% off), so I avoided cash where possible. I exchanged USD when I arrived. 3. I was surprised to see the Conan O'Brien mural (from his tv show Conan Must Go) painted over for an Axe Body Spray advertisement. 4. Take the ferry to Uruguay. You can visit the resort town of Colonia del Sacramento for about $50 each way. It's only an hour and is a good day trip. 5. You can definitely see the economic changes that have taken place over the past couple of years. To to the locals I spoke with, people are optimistic but it's been tough with rapid price increases on some items. 6. I didn't leave the city much. There is enough nature to keep a laptop nomad active during free time.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1lh1c8m", "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 16, "created_date": "2025-06-21T17:02:20+00:00", "author": "develop99", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lh1c8m/a_month_in_buenos_aires/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lh1c8m/a_month_in_buenos_aires/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 3075, "flair": "Trip Report", "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "hot", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:30:44.885368+00:00"}

{"id": "1lh84id", "title": "European nomads who \"settled\" in Georgia: is staying in the country for 183 days really that necessary?", "content": "Assume you obtained legal residency in Georgia (work residency), and applied for Individual Entrepreneur + Small Business Status (1% tax on revenue up to 160k euros per year). Then you probably get paid on Wise (that you opened with your georgian tax ID) or a Georgian bank. Now, according to the FAQ on the website of Solo bank (georgian bank), they only require you to do kyc once and self-certificate that you are tax resident in Georgia. If that applies, they explicitly say your account will not be reported to other countries. They also say that you only need to communicate them a new tax residency when there's a change. I assume the same rules are used by Wise. Banks and brokerage accounts do not ask you for the tax residency certificate as far as I know. Now let's say, after the first year of real tax residency, you start nomading again and lose official tax residency in Georgia (meaning you won't get a tax residency certificate from Georgia). But you also never trigger any other tax residency. Under these conditions, you don't have to tell the bank anything, and according to them, they won't report you as a non-resident. They simply don't care much, unless you become tax resident in another country. So what's the risk of just keep nomading? You won't get a tax residency certificate to protect you against double taxation, but no countries other than Georgia (in theory) will know how much you make. And even then, you could legally stop filing income statements in Georgia if you don't live there half of the year, so not even the georgian revenue service will know how much you make. (Or you could keep voluntarily paying the 1% tax, even if you don't have to. They will know how much you make, but i'm not sure if they will report you to your home country). So what's the catch here? Kyc refreshes from your brokerage account? This will probably be IBKR, but as far as I know, they ask for tax ID and proof of residential address.. something that you can easily maintain in Georgia by keeping renting an apartment. What am I missing about this setup?

We were aiming for a mix of city life, skiing, and some more relaxed local experiences — and it turned out to be an awesome balance. **✈️ Trip Overview** **When:** January 2025 **Where:** Tokyo → Kyoto → Niseko → Sapporo **Length:** 15 days **Where we stayed:** Airbnb + hotels **🗼 Days 1–4: Tokyo (Ikebukuro**) * Flew into Haneda (HND) — way easier than Narita if you're headed into central Tokyo * Stayed in an Airbnb in Ikebukuro — felt like a slightly more local Shinjuku * Tons of bars, great food, and super convenient train access **Quick tip:** Add a Suica card to your Apple/Google Wallet before arriving. It makes transit way easier — no more fumbling with machines. **Weather:** Cold but manageable. Bring layers and a warm coat, especially at night. **⛩️ Days 4–7: Kyoto** * Took the Shinkansen down from Tokyo — easy and scenic * Stayed near Higashiyama, which ended up being our favorite part of the city **Kyoto favorites:** * Fushimi Inari Shrine (go early — sunrise was peaceful and almost empty) * %ARABICA coffee with a view of the river * Rocking Bar ING — Favorite bar in Kyoto * Wandering along Shijo Street for snacks and shopping * Bamboo Forest in Arashiyama was fine, but wouldn’t go out of my way for it next time **🎿 Days 7–12: Nisek**o * Flew from HND to Sapporo (CTS), then took a bus to Niseko * Stayed near the slopes with ski-in/ski-out access **Niseko thoughts:** * Snow was incredible — no surprise there * Not ideal if you're looking for nightlife or restaurants beyond the resort * Buses stop running pretty early (\\~7PM), and taxis are tough to find * If you care more about skiing than nightlife, it’s perfect * I’ve also skied in Hakuba — personally liked the terrain and après scene there better **Tip:** Book your bus from CTS to Niseko well ahead of time, especially if you’re going during ski season. **🏙️ Days 12–15: Sappor**o * Stayed in an Airbnb downtown * The city felt like a mini Tokyo — way more relaxed and really walkable **Sapporo highlights:** * Ramen alley near Susukino * Sapporo Beer Hall (a little touristy, but still fun) * The underground mall network is HUGE — great for when it's freezing outside **Overall take:** This trip hit everything we were hoping for — good balance of big cities, cultural spots, and snow.

{"id": "1lhovk1", "title": "Is PM Anwar Ibrahim an IMF Puppet in a Songkok? Let’s Talk.", "content": "I’ve been connecting the dots lately between Malaysia’s economic policy and the typical playbook of the IMF/World Bank structural adjustment model. And I have a serious question: Is PM Anwar Ibrahim governing Malaysia… or managing it for global finance? Let’s break it down. ##Historicaly Back in 1997–98, during the Asian Financial Crisis, Anwar (then Finance Minister) supported IMF-style austerity: - Higher interest rates - Spending cuts - Floating the ringgit - Rejected capital controls He clashed hard with Mahathir, who pegged the ringgit and called the IMF bluff. Anwar got sacked. ## After That? 🌎 He became tight with the West: - Georgetown University fellow - Linked to Soros-funded Open Society networks - Friends with Paul Wolfowitz (Iraq war guy) - Supported by Al Gore & Hillary Clinton - Regular face in neoliberal international circles ##📊 Today’s Red Flags: 1. Targeted subsidy removal (fuel, utilities) 2. Talk of bringing back GST/SST 3. Obsessed with “fiscal discipline” over rakyat’s real pain 4. Promoting privatisation-lite language 5. Constantly pushing for foreign direct investment (FDI) And the language? Straight out of a Washington think tank: “Good governance.” “Fiscal reform.” “Public-private partnerships.” Sounds like a Davos panel, not a rakyat-first government. ##🚩 My Take: Anwar might wear a songkok but he speaks the language of the IMF playbook. He’s not fighting global finance, he’s managing us for them. He isn’t a “spy” or “agent”, he’s a technocrat with elite Western loyalties. And that’s just as dangerous, because he’ll dismantle public support systems and call it “modernisation.” ##🗣️ What do you think? Is Anwar truly sovereign in vision or playing caretaker for global debt lords? Can Malaysia afford a market-first, IMF-friendly prime minister in 2025? I want to hear from both sides. But let’s keep it real, not fanboy nonsense.

{"id": "1lhn7s7", "title": "Menjaga/ mencintai alam sekitar: Theory and Practice", "content": "(P.S. : DO NOT go and harass person A, or people IRL who behave like them. I know that Person A has my best interests at heart, but this is their best attempt at expressing such, you can imagine them to be one generation older than the typical Reddit user.) Hi all, so for context, these past few weeks I have been taken up \"picking up trash from the street\" as a hobby, mainly for the following reasons: 1. It is a relatively cheap activity to finance (30 small plastic bags (as above) cost RM2.20, while 100 plastic gloves cost RM4.50). 2. It keeps me moving for a stretched period of time (lots of bowing down and squatting needed, not to mention hand reflexes) 3. It satisfies my brain's need for novelty (I do this sporadically, and change areas every time I do so) 4. I've been taught to \"menjaga alam sekitar\" since young, and since I'm still able-bodied, I just thought why not possibly help the environment while doing enough exercise for the day? 5. It has taught me delayed gratification, in the sense that I wasn't able to use my hands to rub off sweat from my forehead When I'm actually picking up trash, I make sure all precautions are taken, especially wearing plastic gloves to not come into direct contact with the sampah. And also to stay away from people as far as possible to not let them touch the dirty bags. It took a few times to realise our civic sense has a long, long way to go, because be it Mixue and Bingxue cups, empty mineral water bottles, plastik ikat tepi with water (and mosquitoes hatching) inside, satay sticks, gutka packaging, you name it, I'd have at least picked up dozens of each. I didn't tell Person A that I was going out to kutip sampah near my temporary place of stay. They saw me sweating like mad when I came back, and asked me whether I went for a jog, then when I told them truthfully what I have been doing for the past hour, imagine the shock when Person A told me the following statements, in no particular order: 1. Why did you even do this? It's useless! You go help people who don't care clean up, then a few days later the streets will become littered all over again, so what's the point? 2. Boy, I know you have noble intentions, but you did so in the wrong context. It is wrong of you to pick up trash in front of the stores because it is none of your business and fully the shop's responsibility. If, say, you went to the park or along the beach to pick up trash instead, then people will praise your actions. 3. People will think that you're a crazy kid! A decent guy who goes to university and all, wearing proper attire going outside just to kutip sampah? If you have that much energy, why not go to the gym or go for a swim downstairs? 4. You do all of this for free, that what do the street cleaners have to do left? You're basically stealing their iron rice bowl and rendering them jobless! Then wtf is the gov using our taxpayer money for? To hire these f\\*tards to sit around and do nothing? 5. Please don't ever do that again, I don't want you to kena polis tangkap for displaying lunatic behaviour... Right when these statements came out of Person A's mouth, I was in complete dissonance that I could only grin at that moment! Because, isn't being in direct involvement with protecting the environment the right thing to do? And point is, Person A never even witnessed me doing the action. I didn't mention much about it thereafter. A friend also chimed in from a neutral standpoint to remind me that what I do is extremely unordinary, and because my actions have deviated so much from social norms, I am bound to get stares, and it'd be really good if more NGO initiatives were to be pushed. I thank my friend because prior to this the thought of \"orang lain akan cakap apa\" didn't even cross my mind. So I went to kutip sampah again today, this time amassing 11 small blue packets. A kind Malay abang even offered me to tumpang his motosikal because I had to cross a busy road to properly dispose of the waste in the trash collection spot. Some people got puji a bit lah, but basically 98% of the people gave zero fks. This discussion has perplexed me for quite some time. Do any of you here have similar experiences, and to more senior nyets, help me understand from what POV is Person A coming from.

{"id": "1lhm072", "title": "12 days in the Caucasus – Does this route make sense? And should we rent a car in Georgia?", "content": "Hey everyone :) My friend and I (both 25M) are planning a 12-day trip across the Caucasus this September. We're flying into Baku and out of Yerevan. We know it's not enough time to fully do justice to each country, but we're locked in on seeing all three and trying to make it work efficiently. We're into mountain scenery, good food and wine, and a bit of nightlife. Here's what we're thinking so far: day 1: baku – arrive in the afternoon, walk around the old city, maybe check out the waterfront and try to catch a vibe in the evening day 2: baku – day trip to Gobustan, Yanar Dag, Atashgah Fire Temple, etc. might squeeze in some architecture or beach stuff if there's time day 3: baku – slow morning, fly to tbilisi in the afternoon (€69 flight), explore a bit and check out the nightlife day 4: kazbegi – drive up north, stop at Mtskheta and Jvari, Ananuri Fortress, Gudauri viewpoint. sleep in Kazbegi day 5: kazbegi – hike to Gergeti Trinity. not sure if we should also try to do Truso Valley (ATVs look amazing) this day or keep it simple day 6: kakheti – long drive south through Gori (maybe check out the Stalin museum?) and Uplistsikhe cave city, then head to either Telavi or Sighnaghi to sleep day 7: kakheti – wine tastings and chilling. probably visiting Tsinandali Estate, Shumi, and maybe Khareba Tunnel day 8: tbilisi – drive back late morning, explore the city properly (sulfur baths, Narikala Fortress, etc), maybe nightlife day 9: tbilisi – morning in the city, then fly to yerevan in the evening (€82 flight) day 10: yerevan – explore the city, Cascade, markets, cafes. possibly hit Khor Virap if time allows day 11: yerevan – day trip to Garni + Geghard, maybe Lake Sevan or Dilijan if we're feeling ambitious day 12: fly out in the morning So here’s what I’m wondering: – is this too much time in Georgia compared to Armenia or Azerbaijan? we feel like it deserves the extra days but curious what others think – is the Kazbegi > Gori > Kakheti route efficient or too much in one day? – is Truso Valley worth squeezing in or would that just be overkill? – Telavi vs Sighnaghi as a base for Kakheti – which one feels more relaxed but still close to wineries? – most importantly: should we rent a car in Georgia? it would cost about €350 total for 6 days (\\~€200 each with fuel). is that worth it for the route above, or would marshrutkas and day tours do the job just fine? Any feedback from people who’ve done something similar would be awesome. Maybe I missed important stops.

I’m here because no matter how hard i’ve searched online i can’t find any answer other than “do it anyway, ask for forgiveness not permission” - I’m 22F and indian too lol, though my parents consider themselves on the liberal side, my dad is pretty happy for me to go as long as i’m safe, and my mum is dead against me going solo at any point and wants me to go with a friend desperately. She’s said that the source of her anxiety would be from other people rather than not trusting me, and said that it’s safer if you’re with someone. Which i don’t disagree with, but the purpose of this trip for me is to do it solo, and learn to be more independent than i was at uni, and truly learn how to exist for just myself and not be responsible for anyone else. She’s told me tonight to try and find some groups to meet people beforehand and then go the same route as long as i meet them here, but i’ve said that it completely disrupts the point of the trip, and even if i did want to travel with friends or my boyfriend, we have different modes of travel and people won’t even have saved up money. My problem is i feel really guilty doing anything to worsen her anxiety, and i know im an adult whose 22 and i can just go, but she’ll say things like “No i don’t control you, and you can go i won’t stop you, but you’ll go knowing that you’ve compromised my peace of mind” So i find it really difficult trying to go travelling knowing that i’m going to be putting her through so much worry, but equally i want to go? and i’ve done everything i can think of so far like plan my route, save up the money, plan an itinerary with places to stay and activities. It’s also SAE so a lot of the people in the hostels will be a similar age and i know i’ll make friends with everyone really quickly. I just don’t know how i can convince her to stop worrying, and how i leave without a guilty conscious. Any help would be much appreciated:( sorry for the rant lol !

{"id": "1lh4hyi", "title": "Please help me make my mind up...", "content": "*Paragraph incoming...* So, April 2025, I (28M) went to Australia for my first month on a WHV-417 and stayed with some family as I'd had enough of the U.K, had enough of my life back here due to stress and some other unfortunate out of my control reasons, and wanted to start fresh, working in Australia, then eventually saving up more and going to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Japan. I landed a job after two weeks, (the less said there the better, but it was sketchy and I got out of dodge after a day out in the sticks), and decided to enjoy the rest of my time in Melbourne without stressing too much on finding more work. After a month I started getting cold feet. Worrying about funds (I had enough, still do), if I'd done the right right thing by going out there, but the daily grind and money obsession that is engrained into us in the U.K got the better of me and I came home. Stupidly. Partly to make my mind up on whether I was doing the right thing by travelling (I was) and leaving my old life behind, but my brain was so hyperactive whilst I was out there, I just couldn't think clearly. Constantly doubting my every decision. I was lucky in that I had somewhere to stay for free, and it didn't really cost me anything apart from the flights and the daily spends. As soon as I landed in the U.K, I knew that I shouldn't have so hastily come home, but coming home for a month has certainly given me time to slow down, and re-assess my situation. Unfortunately, the family I was staying with in Melbourne is going away for 12 months for work and can no longer offer me somewhere to stay, meaning if I go back to Melbourne (which I'd like to do) I'll have to fund accomodation myself. No big deal, I have the funds, but this is where I'm torn... The money I have could go on a pretty wild trip to Japan right now, and last me at least 2 months. Japan is my dream destination, and somewhere I was hoping to work towards. Do I use my money to go Japan, or, do I use it to put a down on a flat-share/AirBnB in Melbourne, find a job asap (at risk) and use some of those savings to get myself set up, and hope to earn that money back in Melbourne. I am so torn! I have the opportunity to go to my dream destination at my finger tips, but not necessarily how I originally envisioned. I envisioned working for it in Australia for 10/12 months and then finally going to Japan for 2/3 months at the end of my WHV and then assessing whether I want to go back and do a second year. *FYI, I was debating flying back to Melbourne weeknaftr next via Hong Kong for 5 days, just to scratch a little itch* and then settle down to work in Australia until April, providing I find a job.* My family all hold split opinions on this. Some say go now and do whatever I want to do and follow my heart, some say I stay in the U.K a bit longer, find a temporary job and think about it more. The more I think about it, the more it blows my brain. Apologies for the waffling.

{"id": "1lh02dx", "title": "Solo travel questions about Prague, Dresde and Berlin", "content": "Hello to you all. I (25M) have just booked my flights for my third Summer solo traveling. Last year I went to Paris and two years ago to Budapest (the two of them to see the Olympics and World Athletics Championship). This year I'm going both to Prague first and Berlín afterwards, with a most likely stop in Dresde. My flight arrives in Prague the 2nd of August at 09:35 and the return flight departs from Berlín the 13th of August at 12:15, so I have 10 full days, most part of the first day and a couple of hours of last days (even if I guess I won't have time for much that day). I come here to ask a couple of questions regarding my trip and itinerary. How many days should I dedicate to each city? My first idea was to stay in Prague from the 2nd until the 6th at lunch time more or less (where I would want to do a full day trip to Karlovy Vary and a half day trip to Kutna Hora, take a bus to Dresde, where I would spend the 6th afternoon, do a day trip to Bastei the 7th and then spend a couple of hours in Dresde the 8th, before going to Berlin at more or less 14:00 or so. Then, I would stay in Berlin from the 8th until the 13th. In Berlin I would want to go to Potsdam and Sachsenhausen. Does that plan make sense at all? Would it be enough in each of the cities or maybe too much or to little in any of these? Besides, I would be grateful if you could give me some recommendations regarding the must see or must do visits in Prague but specially in Berlin (and in Dresde, why not). For example, is the zoo worth it? Or even the Olympic Stadium? As you can probably tell by my last two solo trips I'm an athletics freak and that Olympic Stadium has so much history in there that it attracts me quite, but i'm not sure if it could be a waste of time. And anoher question regarding visits and similars, is there any tourist card or anything similar to make all the visits cheaper? Regarding the transportation, I have read that both cities have good public transportation via tram and metro, but are there any affordable options to book bikes and get to know the cities by bike? Finally, what are the local dishes I have to try 100%? And which restaurants? My final questions are about the hostels I should stay in. My idea of the perfect hostel would be a social hostel, with a great common area and activities to get to know other guests, but without it being too much party oriented. The location and the price are also important, obviously, and I would sleep in dorms. I think I have already made my choices but I would want you to make me other recommendations if these hostels won't fit with what I'm looking for. First of all, I think it's the one in Dresde the only one I'm 100% sure I have already decided. It is Lollis Homestay Dresde. I shouldn't miss with that one, right? In Berlin my biggest doubts are between EastSeven Berlin or The Circus Hostel, but I'm leaning more towards the first one. Which of those should I choose? Or are there better options like Heart Of Gold or similars... And what about Prague? The main option right now is Sir Toby's Hostel, but I'm not sure at all. Other hostels like Hostel Elf or Ahoy Hostel seem interesting. Any other option I might be missing? Is Sir Toby's Hostel a good choice? I don't know if anyone has read until here, but in that case I would thank you a lot if you could answer some of the questions (I know, they are maybe too much). Thank you so much and I will probably come back for a trip report after it.

{"id": "1l0mq9r", "title": "I was sexually assaulted by my housemate in Malaysia. What legal actions can I take now?", "content": "Hi everyone, I’m posting this anonymously because I’m still shaken, but I really need advice. Last week, I was sexually assaulted while sleeping in my room at a rented unit in Cheras. I live in a shared unit with individual rooms. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling someone kissing me and touching my chest and genitals. I jumped up and turned on the lights — it was one of the male housemates from another room. He claimed he was drunk and “entered the wrong room”, but I find it hard to believe. Our room layouts are very different. He even had the clarity to take off his glasses and place them on my desk before proceeding to assault me. It felt very deliberate. I went to the police the next day and filed a report. The officer said the options would be either for him to move out, or be charged and jailed. So far, he’s agreed to move out. However, I don’t think that’s enough. This wasn’t a misunderstanding — he molested me while I was asleep. I feel extremely violated, unsafe, and traumatized. I now have trouble sleeping at night, wake up with panic, and can’t focus on my studies. My landlord has been supportive and asked if I want to move instead, and the guy offered to pay a few months of my rent as “compensation” if he can’t find a new place. But deep down, I feel like this isn’t fair — he shouldn’t just walk away by paying some rent. I’m thinking of pursuing this further, but I don’t have much money as a student. I’m now asking: • What legal options do I have in Malaysia? • If I proceed legally, would I still be eligible for compensation? • Will he be listed with a criminal record? • Should I seek NGO or legal aid support? • Am I allowed to post about this publicly or will that cause issues later? If you’ve been through something similar or have legal knowledge, I’d really appreciate your guidance. I just want to make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

It's hard to explain what makes CDMX so special because the city is by no means perfect. Maybe it's the eccentricity and edginess of the place. One night I was awakened at 1am by someone singing outside, accompanied by someone playing the trumpet. It all sounded so beautiful I wasn't even upset they'd woken me up. Another time I was heading back to my apartment when I spotted a group of furries walking down the street as if it was the most normal thing in the world. No one seemed fazed by anything in CDMX and even people who might not typically fit there seemed to fit there. As far as safety goes, I felt perfectly safe in the city (unlike in Bogota). Now maybe it was because I was in touristy areas doing touristy things, but I also got lost quite a bit and just wandered around. Not once did I feel threatened or as if I was in danger. I wasn't brave enough to try the street food, but I did have the best cheese danish of my life there. Traffic? Probably the worst I've experienced, and the altitude and air pollution dried out my eyes and mouth to the point where I had to drink water constantly, but even those things weren't huge negatives for me. The people were friendly, cool and down-to-earth (except for maybe in Polanco). And the city was affordable compared to European and American cities. Now could I live in Mexico City? No. But did Mexico City live up to the hype? Yeah, it did.

{"id": "1l9mkaw", "title": "My 8 Days in Beautiful Taiwan", "content": "So, after 8 days in Taiwan, I have finally concluded my journey. Half dying from heat stroke, half very fulfilled, returned back home. The first thing I can say is that I think I chose the wrong time to visit, as the heat was literally so punishing, it became unbearable by the end of my journey. And this is coming from someone who lives in a Gulf country. I just went outside, which is 40+ degrees, and this 40+ degrees is much, much easier to bear than 32 degrees in Taiwan due to dry vs. humid weather. I spent 4 days in Taipei, 2 days in Tainan, and 2 days in Kaohsiung. Assigned more time in Taipei to embrace the city as much as I could and do some side trips which gave me the flexibility to visit Jiufen, Beitou, Yangminshan and Maokong. Also made sure to spend some time in the city to visit important places like Elephant Mountain, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Ximending Street, Dihua Street, Longshan Temple, Taipei 101 etc. The rest of the time, I spent exploring Taipei’s alleys, different cafes, bubble teas at every stop, creative parks, cultural centers, and museums. People were very accommodating, even though the language barrier was real sometimes, though not much in Taipei. In places like Tainan and Kaohsiung, you still get the looks of being an alien (not Asian) in that city, which I always like. Compared to Japan or other Southeast Asia countries, there are far fewer white tourists and this might be the reason, or completely cultural. I would say Tainan and Kaohsiung were a little bit of a letdown for me even though in Tainan I visited some historical sites like Anping and the old towns and streets, still felt underwhelming. So, I left pretty quickly for Kaohsiung but I need to say it wasn't much different. It’s definitely an incredible port and beach city where you can stroll around but I believe you should spend more time, particularly in Tainan, to really understand or embrace these cities. People often compare Tainan to Kyoto; however, as someone who has also been to Kyoto, I wouldn’t compare them 1:1. That would definitely kill your mood and interest since they are nothing alike and Tainan is something completely different. That said, it does have alleyways and small streets you can get lost in and I think one or two days isn’t enough to really understand these places. It’s a slower city, so if you’re looking for something more dynamic, maybe Taipei and then Kaohsiung would suit you better. I’m definitely planning a second visit to see Taichung and, most importantly, Taroko Gorge if it ever opens again and to visit Alishan in the coldest time possible to experience the gorgeous scenery and the Forest Train. So if you’re wondering whether you should visit Taiwan, I would 100% recommend it. But my recommendation would be to spend more time in Taipei and visit the important places on the eastern side (like Taroko Gorge and Alishan), especially if you like trekking, quiet moments, and national parks. But my most important advice would be: **do not visit the country during June, July, or August.** Go in a more comfortable season, because the summer heat is incredibly punishing and really makes it hard to enjoy everything else.

{"id": "1l70jpo", "title": "5 nights in Iraqi Kurdistan (April 2025)", "content": "Finally getting around to writing up my experience in Iraqi Kurdistan. I tend to travel off the beaten path and I'm a suckler for history and wine, so naturally going to Kurdistan was appealing for me. For context, I'm a gay white American women that traveled to Kurdistan on my EU passport, but going with my US passport would have been fine. Itinerary: The trip in total was 5 nights: one night to myself - which I spent in Erbil - and 4 nights with a private tour guide in different parts of Iraqi Kurdistan (3 nights in Soran and 1 night in Duhok). We visited Lalish, Shaqlawa (wine), Aqrah/Akre, Duhok, Shanidar cave, Amedi, and more). Attire: I generally wear black pants and dark/neutral color t-shirts for my day-to-day so I continued to do so in Kurdistan, and had no issues. I did bring a shawl with me to use whenever going in mosques (obviously not needed for men). Food: f\\*cking phenomenal, literally changed my perspective of kebabs. The meat melted in my mouth and tasted so fresh, and the cuts of tomatoes and onions to go with them were flavorful. We did a traditional Kurdish breakfast in Duhok that I will literally fly back to Kurdistan just to eat again. Safety: incredibly safe; at no point did I feel like I was in an unsafe location. The only thing that I had to get used to was how many people wanted a photo with me, simply for being a tourist. Cost: very affordable (to no surprise); approximately $400–$6.90 USD per meal (kebab + tea). Cultural norms: unfortunately the norm where men and women/children would eat, pray etc. in different parts of the communal space does exist in most parts of Kurdistan, so that was a bit uncomfortable to get adapted to. I didn't always have to eat on the second floor of restaurants given that foreigner women are treated nearly the same as local men, but if the second floor was an option, then we'd eat there. There are parts of Erbil where this isn't expected though. Tips: * Staying in Soran is ideal for day trips around Kurdistan; it's also much closer to the heart of Kurdish culture so the food there was fantastic * I did the e-Visa and Passport Control only took 5 minutes (including wait time) * I used AsiaCell and had service in practically all parts of Kurdistan that I went to except parts of the countryside between Duhok and Soran (which you practically only drive through anyway) * Bring sandals/flip-flops for showers * Be prepared to go for a few days without coffee; the closer to Kurdish country (Soran), the more prominent tea is * Dream City neighborhood in Erbil is ideal for women traveling solo; I went to smoke shisha at Tarwika Bakery (highly recommend) and there were multiple women going out with their friends smoking shisha Will I go back? Absolutely. I'm hoping to go back in September to watch wine get processed but that's TBD; nevertheless, I see myself going back quite a few times as I have many more parts of Kurdistan to explore.

And especially very tasty local varieties \\- traffic rules do not exist, zebra crossings are suggestions, traffic lights are better suggestions (they only apply to straight ahead, but they remain suggestions) and the road signs are just confusing. The only rule here is the law of the horn. \\- if the Dutch are born on a bicycle, the Vietnamese are born on a scooter. The rest of the family is already on one of those. \\- Banh Mi: thanks to the French for introducing the baguette here. And especially thanks to the Vietnamese who gave it such a delicious (and cheap) twist. Vietnam is the first Asian country where we had a delicious local lunch (with bread) every day \\- Everyone is polite and wants to provide you with the highest quality service, but hardly anyone speaks English \\- If you are easily overstimulated, it is best to avoid the streets, because the constant wailing of the horn will quickly knock you down \\- Do you want to buy tickets somewhere? Then choose your desired option at the ticket counter and then be told to which other counter you will be taken by bus so that you can buy it there, after which you will be brought back and the tour can begin. \\- so much is arranged so randomly and you will often wonder what is going on and why no one explains it to you, but everything always works out fine. It all - somehow - really works in Vietnam. \\- Ha Giang is in our top 5 coolest things ever experienced. The feeling on the back of a motorbike in this area is really indescribable. I recommend Tiem Tours if you are looking for a company. \\- If you want to see animals on your trip; don't go to Vietnam. There are barely any (wild) animals. \\- Banh Xeo and Banh Mi are the best. \\- The weather in Vietnam fluctuates so much that you have to be lucky no matter what season you go.

{"id": "1lac9m0", "title": "First time in hostel and completely ignored, is this normal?", "content": "I'm 25F, and it is my first time traveling solo in Europe and decided to stay in a non-party hostel (in a mixed 8-person dorm). I heard hostels are very social, and as an introvert, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and meet some people. Yesterday when being given a tour of the place, I came across two guys in the hallway, and said hello. I proceeded to get looked up and down, then they turned away and walked back into their room. I didn't think much of it, but when we arrived to the room I was staying in, 4 people were on their bunks near the door, and when I said \"hello\", no one responded. I make eye-contact with the guy who is in the bunk below me, say \"hello\" and again, nothing. The rest continue their conversation. A little later, I make my way into the common area with a few people, and I said hello and made eye contact, but no one responds and they continued talking amongst themselves. After grabbing a glass of water, I tried striking up a conversation with a girl sitting nearby by asking her which country she was from. After getting a response, she turned away, and starting talking to another person. What am I doing wrong? I could just be too sensitive, but this has left me feeling discouraged and a little dishearten. It honestly felt a little dehumanizing, like I wasn't worth talking to. Edit: Spelling An update: Hello everyone, thank you for all your comments, advice, and sharing your personal experiences! When I wrote this, I very felt dejected, and didn't expect the amount of traction this post would gain. I decided that the hostel I'm in isn't for me, and have booked a cute hotel for the rest of my stay in Prague! I had a wonderful time walking around Mala Strana today and am having a blast overall :) I'm going to make the most of my next hostel stay when I visit Copenhagen in a few weeks.

These are my impressions: * Holy mother of sweet Jesus is the land beautiful. * South Africans are funny, welcoming, good looking * I did not experience any crime (Cape Town area) * Because of constantly reading about crime in South Africa prior to landing, I came conditioned with a lot of fear. While at a park outside my bed and breakfast in Muizenberg, a man and woman in their car asked to borrow my lighter while in their car. I threw it on the ground, shouted \"you can have it\" and then made a hasty retreat back to secured wall of the bed and breakfast, thinking they were going to kidnap me or something worse.... YEA. be careful with those weed edibles, y'all, they are legal in South Africa (ish) but they will make your inflated fears seem 10x as bad * The quality you get for American dollars is kinda ridiculous. I'm surprised the place isn't flooded with Americans, although I did hear much more American accents here than any other place than Greece * The food tastes better in South Africa e.g. things like Smoked Salmon are MUCH more flavorful than in America * White people were friendly toward me -- a black East African foreigner with U.S nationality --- but I would sometimes hear some nonsense like the idea that the \"ANC\" would give me a job if I moved to South Africa simply because I was black. In Simon's Town, I was staying at an AirBnB and some old white dudes welcomed me with beer and tasty food and weirdly at the same time reminisced about how good things were during apartheid \"the navy was good then\". LMAO! * Visiting Ruben Island and seeing the tiny prison cell Nelson Mandela was held in -- including some flimsy hole-riddled wool mat for sleeping on -- is a great way to gain perspective on your life and understand whatever your problems, people have had it MUCH worse. It's crazy to me in a land so beautiful that man was treated so UGLY and yet he emerged from the prison with a BEAUTIFUL heart and somehow found the strength to deal with even more craziness after his release like a near-civil war situation in Natal and a corrupt police force actively working against the country. WOW! Nelson you are the physical reflection of the land. * While called \"third world,\" South Africa punches above its weight. Y'all have toilet paper at the reservation near Cape of Good Hope.

{"id": "1lcpm4l", "title": "Cultural communication styles- Italian stranger, the most magical moment of my trip.", "content": "Me, Swedish, 30F, first ever solo trip. Florence, summertime. Tourists everywhere. Ive been feeling alone and overwhelmed for the whole week; the days have been way too hot, the distances to walk too long, the traffic too loud Ive forgotten my passport at a swimming location in a mountain and at my breaking point, I ended up googling for any place to get an Italian dinner, that isn’t too expensive, and isn’t chock full of tourists Exhausted, I arrive to a tiny hole in the wall with rickety folding chairs lined up in rows outside. At first I thought it was an outdoor movie screening. Turns out it’s the queue for the restaurant Exhausted, defeated, I resign myself to this queue Thank god ive at least brought my book. I sit and read a book about the history of Anarchism in Europe while an American girl speaks loudly on her phone* (I should mention here I am Swedish, and Americans rarely visit Sweden. At this point in my trip I am so tired of Americans being everywhere, speaking at twice the volume of everyone around them, taking up twice the space with all of their bags and the way they sit and spread out with their friends—- not blaming them; I understand that your country is large with space in abundance. Here in Europe the rules for polite and rude are different than yours. Not your fault! Not blaming you, but I have to set the scene that at this point in my trip my mental space is ”Europe should close its borders to Americans in May and not open until September, or at least we should fit them with decibel meters upon arrival) So I sit there, on the uneven ground laid by Romans a thousand years ago. Next to the Roman arch; coming from Sweden it feels familiar, I feel at home. It’s just like our old town, or Gotlands medieval ring wall- except about 1000 degrees hotter. In Swedish summer, the sun barely sets. The concept of starry sky while wearing a t-shirt is completely foreign to me. But so I sit. The sky turns from blue to orange to pink to navy to deepest blue. I wait. I wait. I read. I wait. American girl next to me yaps loudly. Every now and then we move rickety chairs in the queue The Italian lady who presumably owns the restaurant comes out every now and then and asks in Italian how big the groups are People hold up fingers, I hold up mine. ”una. Sola” ”Sola??!? Segure?” I nod I am shown to a tiny tiny table right in the most high traffic path, and given a menu entirely in Italian. Hostess smiles warmly, I feel very welcomed. The waiter, a young man with beautiful dark hair and piercing green eyes, speaks Italian very slowly to me, encouraging me to keep trying with Italian. I have 9% battery and the building is 700 years old stone, so of course no reception. I try to understand the menu to my best ability. After ive placed my order, to my surprise, as this would never happen in Sweden, an Italian man in his 60s is seated across from me at this tiny table I look up from my book, and nod ciao. I am really not in a social mood at all. He orders, and sinks as deeply into his phone as I am in stories of lawless anarchist vagabonds of the past I feel a bit tense about his presence. The restaurant is packed, receiving food takes some time. After a while I relax into his presence, similar to how one might next to a stranger on the subway. The waiter arrives with my starter, homemade ravioli. I eat it quickly and return to my book. Me and the stranger sit in what we northern Europe consider respectful silence Until my main course arrives Absolutely perfectly cooked thin slices, of the most tenderly cooked venison I’ve ever had in my life. For €8. I take my first bite without realizing that I gasp audibly. This is the most magic moment of my trip; The stranger looks up from his phone, perhaps startled, perhaps something else. His whole face is lit up with the warmest smile I’ve seen all week. He looks at me with raised eyebrows, and gives me a nod; a non verbal question; ”good?” I nod back.

Being outside of my comfort zone having to use/practice Spanish every day as well, getting around and eating in restaurants by myself, living without everyday luxuries I have at home, it’s all been so good for me. I have to go back home because I start my new job soon and am moving across the country (US) for it. As I wait for my flight today to go home I honestly can’t stop crying because I don’t want my trip to end, but I know I’m extremely privileged to have even had this opportunity to begin with. I also have a fear of getting stuck in my corporate job for the rest of my life but after meeting so many people of ALL AGES who quit their jobs to travel for a few months or a year, I’m also feeling inspired :) All this being said if anyone has questions about the countries I’ve been traveling, let me know and thank you to this subreddit for inspiring me to take this solo trip to begin with.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1l1kr3h", "score": 541, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 121, "created_date": "2025-06-02T15:19:13+00:00", "author": "lekkerkaas", "subreddit": "solotravel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l1kr3h/first_solo_trip_is_ending_after_a_month_and_i/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l1kr3h/first_solo_trip_is_ending_after_a_month_and_i/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 1496, "flair": null, "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "top", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:34:37.179485+00:00"}

After we finished eating breakfast, a British guy sitting behind us who clearly was offended came up to my friend and told him “I don’t think British people are lazy”. I felt embarrassed. Later on, we went sightseeing and he was tiring to be around with. He was always asking questions and I was exhausted of answering all the time. I felt like I was babysitting him. Also what I didn’t like and what annoyed me is that he isn’t very careful when crossing the streets and always wants to cross when a car or tram could come any minute. To me it feels careless and irresponsible. A disaster about to happen. I got injured while travelling in the past so I know how terrible that feels, and I would rather wait rather than risk my health or safety. The cherry on the cake was at the end of the day after a long day of walking. We were going back to the hostel from a museum in the city. We got in the underground station and he quickly entered the subway while I was still coming down the stairs. I didn’t even know whether that subway was going in the right direction and Google maps was still loading on my phone. He got inside the packed subway and it was few seconds before the door closed. In that moment I personally didn’t want to run or rush but he made me rush to get in which was very dangerous and I could have easily tripped and injured myself. The door closed right after I got in and out of anger I immediately told him how bad this was and he shouldn’t have rushed like that. Then he was telling me “why are you humiliating me in front of people? Why are you making a scene?” I wasn’t shouting but I was clearly angry and also angry that he was changing the subject. I decided to stay silent and wait until we got off our stop then opened up the subject again. We had a small argument and decided we’re not going to talk about it anymore and move on (after he said that he got the message). I’m back resting in my private room now but this incident is still on my mind. He is staying for two more nights while I’m staying for three more nights then going to another destination alone, and we’re both staying at the same hostel. I’m not sure if I should do anything differently from today on based on how my best friend behaves while travelling, or whether we should still stick to the plan of sightseeing together and hope tomorrow is better?", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1l2hd4d", "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 73, "created_date": "2025-06-03T17:06:03+00:00", "author": "minoandmiko", "subreddit": "TravelNoPics", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1l2hd4d/first_time_travelling_with_one_of_my_friends_and/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1l2hd4d/first_time_travelling_with_one_of_my_friends_and/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 3265, "flair": null, "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "top", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:35:27.745769+00:00"}

{"id": "1ldsakb", "title": "What I wish I knew before moving to Spain", "content": "So, I recently moved to Spain on a digital nomad visa and there's a few things I reallyyyy wish someone had told me before. I originally went to Tarragona (ever heard of it) because it’s a beautiful small city I’d visited before and fallen in love with. It has caribbean-blue water, sandy beaches, a charming old town, and truly awesome and unique strong Catalan traditions and festivals. Most importantly (for me anyway), I \\*thought\\* it was only about 1 hour away from Barcelona, and it was crucial for me that I be 1 hour or less from a big city on public transport IF I was going to live in small town. Turns out, google maps failed me. The train system there isn’t as reliable or frequent at all like google painted. Trains are often delayed...and delayed again. The train system is not nearly as reliable as you might read in online research. So in reality, a trip to Barcelona can easily take 2+ hours on the train and it's not really feasible for a day(or night trip), at least not on a regular basis. So I moved again to Vilanova i la Geltrú, a coastal town much closer to Barcelona and a better fit for me. But breaking my lease early meant a tough talk with my landlord and LUCKILY they were understanding, normally you would incur huge fees and losses. So this might seem like common sense for some of you lol but in case not, my personal advice is if you work remotely and want badly to settle somewhere (like I did) don't overcommit yourself and rush into a lease to settle sooner. Save money beforehand and try short-term rentals or Airbnb for a few months first so you can \"test\" the place out. I wish I’d done that — it would’ve saved me a LOT of money and a LOT of stress.

The good: - Freedom to follow good weather year-round - Rich cultural experiences that weekend travel can't match - Lower cost of living (in some places) stretching my tech salary - Meeting incredible people from diverse backgrounds The challenging: - Visa situations getting more complex (Portugal's D7 requirements just changed again) - The \"Instagram vs. reality\" gap is MASSIVE - Reliable internet remains the eternal struggle - Building genuine community takes intentional effort Unexpected lessons: 1. Slow travel (2+ months per location) is the only sustainable approach 2. Having a \"home base\" to return to provides necessary stability 3. The right gear makes or breaks the experience My current nomad tech stack: - 14\" MacBook Pro (M3) -Portable monitor (Lenovo ThinkVision M14d) - Roost laptop stand + Logitech MX Keys Mini - Sennheiser Momentum 4 (noise cancellation is essential) - Global eSIM (Airalo) + local SIMs as backup - Various productivity tools (Notion, Arc browser, Willow Voice for transcribing interviews) The voice transcription tool has been surprisingly useful - I do a lot of user interviews for my UX research job, and being able to quickly transcribe conversations without typing everything has been a game-changer for working in cafes or coworking spaces.

Want something that meets basic Western standards (your own shower, in-unit washer, no mysterious stains)? 1500-2k+, and lots of landlords dont rent to foreigners. **Night markets are tourist traps.** Fight me. Yeah, they're \"cultural\" or whatever, but after the second visit you realize it's just the same fried, greasy food at every stall. **Food diversity? What food diversity?** For a capital city, the international food scene is shockingly limited. Good luck finding decent Mexican, Middle Eastern, or even good Western food that doesn't cost a fortune.. The subway is solid and the bike infrastructure is actually impressive, I'll give them that. And the 7/11 food is delicious there. But that's about it. Maybe I'm missing something, but honestly? If you're considering Taipei as your next nomad destination, just go to Bangkok.

{"id": "1l410cj", "title": "What it means to be happy.", "content": "After five years of living as a digital nomad, one of the most unexpected lessons I've learned is this: the greatest benefit of the lifestyle might not be the freedom, the travel, or the novelty. But the chance to truly *experiment* with what makes *you* happy. Before this chapter of my life, I lived pretty conventionally: a couple of jobs, a few relationships, a handful of cities. Life was stable, but I didn’t realise how little room I had to *test* what made me feel fulfilled. In more traditional setups, decisions like changing cities, jobs, or even friend groups come with high cost. So you tend to overthink them, or avoid them altogether. Lifestyle changes aren't really treated as experiments... they’re big life decisions. Nomadism, for all its clichés, gives you a kind of sandbox for adulthood. You can shift your environment regularly and start to observe how those shifts affect your mood, productivity, relationships — everything. You get to test your assumptions in real-time. For example: I started out in Valencia, Spain. It had everything I thought I wanted — mountains, beaches, great weather. But I felt incredibly lonely. There was no strong sense of community for me. Later, I moved to Barbados, which *shouldn't* have worked. It was car-dependent, small, and more expensive. But I found a great group of people, and that made all the difference. I even tried two apartments there: one was beachside and Instagram-worthy; the other wasn’t. I was marginally *happier* in the less photogenic one. Since then, I’ve lived in luxury on a low budget in Southeast Asia, and I’ve also lived in cramped, noisy flats. Again — little to no correlation between the “quality” of the space and my overall happiness. The takeaway? Happiness is multi-dimensional, and often, what we assume is important turns out not to be. Some things I thought were non-negotiables ended up being optional. Some things I barely noticed before turned out to matter a lot. You only find that out through trial and error. So here I am, 37 years old, and my current “ideal setup” is simple: strong friend groups, meaningful relationships, receptive to a productive and healthy lifestyle, and a place where my basic needs are comfortably met. Curious to hear from others. What did you *think* would make you happy before becoming a nomad, and what did you learn along the way? Edits: I'm happy this resonates with so many people! I just wanted to make clearer my thoughts. A few comments suggest I have come to the obvious conclusion that it is most important to have good people around me. The main idea I was wanting to put across is that digital nomadism allows for low-cost \"life experiments\" that help you to understand who you are and what matters. I used relationships as an example that I thought would resonate with people, but there are of course many other examples as some of you have mentioned.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1l410cj", "score": 190, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 28, "created_date": "2025-06-05T14:45:20+00:00", "author": "deanl11", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1l410cj/what_it_means_to_be_happy/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1l410cj/what_it_means_to_be_happy/", "is_malaysia_related": false, "text_length": 2897, "flair": "Lifestyle", "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "top", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:36:22.232964+00:00"}

I run into lots of bad luck, that would always lead to me having to make a report to PDRM. Ans every time that I do make a report, the police has always been rude, unkind, and unhelpful. My trips to the police always make me nervous. 1. When i was in high school, we have a pedophile that would expose himself or jerk off in front of the students. As a prefect, I was able to get his plate number and make a police report. The policemen told me that there is nothing they could do about it with just a plate number, and did not take any action. The situation continued. After more parents have joined in to complain to the police, they have decided to park their (empty) car outside our school to scare the pedophile away for 2 days. The pedophile returned shortly after and nothing is done about it. 2. A friend of mine got scammed, and she had the scammer's name and account number. A month after filing a complaint to the police, they started calling her and told her to drop the case. They tried to scare her into doing that by telling her that the trial might take a long time, and she'll have to go back and forth to the courthouse and that she wouldnt be able to attend college classes. I think they were just too lazy to open the investigation. 3. A few weeks ago, i reported to the police about a man who tried to solicit sex services from me. I had his name and phone number, and evidences of solicitation. Which happens to be a crime under section 372. The police has been very rude to me the whole time when taking my statement, and would often yell at me mid-statement. I had to spend 2 hours at the station that day because they insisted that it wasnt a crime, and that \"cases like these are too hard to investigate\" and that \"i shouldve gone through with the solicitation to get more proof\". It was so dehumanising. I couldnt believe at our justice system. It is set in a way where the police are so reluctant to do anything.

Advice needed.", "content": "Tl;dr: Torn between keeping the stability I have in Canada or moving back to Malaysia to be with family, not sure if my supply-chain degree + policy-analysis experience will land good work there. Context: I first came to Canada in 2018 to study, when I was around 20 years old. Graduated in 2022 and have since been working full time here. I also finally received my PR after a painstakingly long process. My plan was always to settle in Canada and eventually sponsor my parents and sister to come here and stay with me as well. Things were going along well until recently, my families’ visitor visa got rejected and I learned that Canada is serious in tightening up their immigration policies now. It suddenly dawned on me that its going to take a very long time (or never at all) until my family can obtain their PR and settle down here with me. Honestly, besides my cushy government job here in Canada, I have nothing. No friends, no meaningful connections, no life. Go to work, go gym, cook dinner, play video games, go to bed, repeat, all alone. It gets even more depressing during winter. My job is not high paying by any means (4.3k net monthly), but it allows me to own a house and a car in a LCOL province here in Canada, buy a plane ticket to go home and visit once a year, good health benefits and work life balance, job security and steady increase in pay every year because of union, etc. In short, the job provides me the stability I dreamed of. But is there really a point if the people I care about is not here by my side? My heart aches as I watch my family get older and older, reminding me of the time I have lost with them. My heart is telling me to come home, but the logical part of me tells me to stay in my cushy stable job, that I won’t be able to be as stress-free while earning enough to afford the things that I want. I am afraid of change and the uncertainty. With that said, here are my questions. How are the job prospects in Malaysia? I have a bachelor’s degree in supply chain/logistics management. However, I have zero work experience in that field (can get additional certificates (APICS), learn power BI, etc to supplement it if necessary). My work experience is more in the realm of social science, being a policy analyst for the provincial government in Canada. Is my skillset something desirable in Malaysia?

I've read it's worth having a car for Cameron Highlands, but not sure where else we'd need it. This is what I've got so far for the itinerary - really appreciate any feedback/thoughts/comments and anything I'm really missing! Thanks!

{"id": "1lfm2fw", "title": "Tips on traveling to Asia - Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia", "content": "HI guys, I was fired from my job last month and I decided that it is very good time to spend more time with my family. We had this little dream that one day we will just take one year off and travel around the world. The unexpected scenario made us do it quicker and travel for shorter period. We decided to travel a little bit to areas we've never been before. We want to visit a few countries which are interesting to us. However it is going to be very slow paced travelling because we've got two kids: 3 yo and 1 yo. We are aiming to find a very cozy places, with a swimming pool, quite close to nice beaches and not so far from towns or cities which we can find good food. We want to go sightseeing a little bit because we want to learn about interesting places and culture, too. So below you will find our plan and I'd love to get some feedback from you. What do you think about it, what do you suggest, what would you change and what tips do you have. Dates are more or less like those below. Those might change a little bit but not so much. We plan to stay around 3 weeks in each country. Most likely we will around 10 days in each place, so 2 places per country. 01.08 - 22.08 Vietnam We plan to stay around Da Nang. We learned that during this time central Vietnam would be the best place to stay and avoid monsoons. We are aware that we will experience high temperatures but hey - that's a part of experience. What do you suggest would be a nice second area to visit and stay? What about Con Dao? Is that a good idea to go there or rain season will ruin our time there? 23.08 - 14.09 Thailand We planned to visit Thai Gulf - Koh Samui. We are still looking for a second destination. We are also open for island hopping so maybe a different island would be recommended. 15.09 - 25.09 Malaysia This one is shorter because we want to travel to Malaysia \"mainland's\" East Coast. Which area would you recommend? 26.09 - 18.10 Indonesia We are looking for a first destination for first 7-10 days and then we will go to Bali. Any recommendations are welcome. 19.10 - 30.10 Malaysia - North Borneo I learned about Borneo a little bit and I feel like it is a place I want to visit. We want to avoid travelling with little kids as much as possible so that's why we want to stay in one or two places maximum. We know we will miss a lot because of this but we don't really care. It is a journey we want to make to experience other part of the world and come closer as a family. My questions below apply to each of the destination. Any of your suggestions and tips are welcome. 1. We want to find nice houses/villas (whatever you call it) with nice, clean standard and preferably garden and/or swimming pool. There might be some days that we won't do anything except spend time home. Do you have any recommendation on specific places? Which sites or apps would you suggest to use to find one? I know a lot of people book the hotel or house when arriving to the country of destination but I don't really want to do it that way. 2. Which things absolutely avoid in each country? I mean like dangerous events, potential scams etc. 3. Which areas do you recommend for staying in certain period of time and fitting to our agenda (nice area, beautiful beaches, a lot of things to see) 4. My wife cannot eat wheat. Basically we call it gluten free diet to make it easier. Anything you recommend on doing when visiting to avoid eating it? 5. Which food is absolutely must-try? 6. Which places in certain areas would you recommend visiting? We love nature, breathtaking views, ruins, historical building, anything culture and religion related (temples, pagodas, monuments). We are open to places that we would have to travel a little bit to see (let's say 1-2h car/bus/train drive in one direction). 7. Potential health issues - any precautions we should take? Vacs to take (I know it's polarizing topic), meds to take, insurance value you suggest. 8. Elephant sanctuary - are there any \"ethical\" sanctuaries where elephants are actually treated well and are located near areas we will be? We don't want to ride them, bath them etc. Just being near them will be enough. 9. Bugs and so on. What sprays to take to avoid mosquitoes, jiggers and so on. What to do to avoid unsuspected guests in boots, clothes, whatever. I basically hate anything that crawls so this will be a hard one for me. 10. My goal for this trip is to learn (or at least try and experience) some kind of sport, most likely a water sport like surfing or anything else actually. Is there any chance to do it while staing in places I suggested. 11. We are also thinking about extending our trip by around 1 month. We were thinking about visiting Cambodia or other closely located countries. Do you have any suggestions? tl;dr - please share your suggestions, tips and what to avoid when traveling to those countries.", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1lfm2fw", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 20, "created_date": "2025-06-19T21:06:12+00:00", "author": "scrooda", "subreddit": "travel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lfm2fw/tips_on_traveling_to_asia_vietnam_thailand/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lfm2fw/tips_on_traveling_to_asia_vietnam_thailand/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 4871, "flair": null, "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "search", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:09.012839+00:00"}

It really helped me structure a rough 3-week itinerary in Malaysia, and I'd like to get some final feedback and suggestions. ## Travel plan (flexible) - **August 19**: arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the evening - **August 20–26**: flight to Borneo, staying in the Sabah region - **August 27**: return to Kuala Lumpur - **August 28 – September 2**: transfer to the east coast, with base on the Perhentian Islands for environmental volunteering and relaxing - **September 3–6**: last few days to be defined, either on the east coast or back in Kuala Lumpur - **September 6/7**: return flight ## Details Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, I'm considering whether to: - stay one night to rest and fly to Borneo the next day, or - take a domestic flight to Borneo directly the same night In Borneo, I’m planning to spend around 5–7 days in the **Sabah region**. I’ve read that it offers interesting experiences in nature, tropical islands, jungle, and biodiversity-related activities, but I haven’t decided yet what to include. After Borneo, I’d head to the east coast, focusing on the **Perhentian Islands**. I found an environmental volunteering opportunity there and would like to spend as much time as possible. The final days are open depending on connections and your suggestions. ## Questions 1. Is the Sabah region safe? 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5–7 days? 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? 6. Besides the Perhentian Islands, which areas on the east coast would you recommend? 7. Is it worth staying a day in Kuala Lumpur upon arrival, or better to fly to Borneo immediately?

{"id": "1lbbm7d", "title": "Need help planning a trip around Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Maldives, and beyond....", "content": "Hellooo all. I don't think I've posted here before. I’m starting to plan a 5 or 6 week trip for early 2026 (Jan-Feb) and would love some advice. It’ll be me, my wife and our 1-year-old. I've got the general outline of the trip down, but there's a few countries that I need help with; either how long I'll be staying there, or where I'll be visiting after. London is my home airport that I'll be flying out of, and back to. Here’s what I’ve got so far: **Pakistan (2 weeks)** * Visiting family (this part is home so nothing to plan here). **Malaysia (up to 7 nights total)** * From Pakistan, I'll be Flying into Kuala Lumpur. * Planning to stay either in Bukit Bintang or near the Petronas Towers. No real itinerary yet, but seems like a good base to travel up and down as needed. * City specific itinerary isn't the focus yet, I usually worry about that nearer the time. Here’s where I need help: * Should I stay all 5 nights in KL? * Or split it: 3 nights KL + 2 nights in Langkawi? Is Langkawi worth it for a couple of nights with a 1-year-old? I think it may be too short of a time to visit and appreciate Langkawi but I've never been so who am I to say lol. * If not Langkawi, maybe Malacca for 1-2 nights? Or any better island options? * At the moment, the plan is to fly into Singapore from here but if I can plan a slow trip down from KL to Singapore, I could just arrange transport via car. **Singapore (5 nights)** * Booked a hotel near Harbourfront (found a decent deal which is the main reason why). * No real plan here yet, just want to explore and take it easy — seems like Singapore’s pretty easy to get around with a baby anyway. **Sri Lanka (5 nights)** * Flying into Colombo from Singapore. Definitely want to explore Singapore airport too so will fly out of there. * Booked a hotel in the centre of Colombo, but open to changing it depending on the route. What I want to do in Sri Lanka: * See elephants. * Experience some jungle/nature. * Explore the city a bit. * Looked into Jaffna but seems a bit too far with a baby and limited time. * Happy to hear any suggested routes that balance nature, wildlife and not too much travelling around. **Maldives (3-4 nights)** * Flying into Male from Colombo. * Currently planning to stay at DusitD2 (7 min speedboat from airport). * Looked at Cinnamon Velifushi but the long boat transfer put me off. Also looked at Sheraton which is about 20 mins speedboat away which is cool. What I’m looking for: * Halal food options. * Some nice stargazing if possible. * I don’t need tons of sitting-around-resort time, 3-4 nights will probably be plenty. * Open to better resort suggestions if anyone has good options that can offer some stargazing spots with good food and drink. Ideally the budget here is around £3,500, inclusive of food, transfers etc. Dusit2 is around £3100 all inclusive, same for Sheraton. Cinammon Velifushi is around £2000 but seems much lower standard all around. The dates here are around 23-27 Jan if that helps but again, 3 nights can be done if needed. **After Maldives (not locked in yet)** * After Maldives I want to stop somewhere on the way to Qatar. Either on the way there, or another stop after Qatar. * Options I’m considering right now: * Qatar > Riyadh > London * Qatar > Jordan > London * Qatar > Istanbul > London * Qatar > Socotra (Yemen) > London * Already done UAE and Oman, so not looking at those this time. * In Qatar I’ve got Raffles Doha penciled in. * I've not got a clue of where I could go after Maldives, before Qatar - but happy to explore options as needed. Any ideas here would be awesome. **Biggest things I need advice on:** * Whether to split KL/Langkawi or stay in KL. * Fly or drive to Singapore (and whether to add Malacca). * Where to base ourselves in Sri Lanka with a 1-year-old. * Any better Maldives resort options that fit what I’m looking for. * Suggestions for best routing after Maldives before heading home. Haven't posted here before so apologies if I've broken any rules, but I've tried really hard not to lol. If you can help with anyyyy part of this trip it would be really helpful.

It really helped me structure a rough 3-week itinerary in Malaysia, and I'd like to get some final feedback and suggestions. ## Travel plan (flexible) - **August 19**: arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the evening - **August 20–26**: flight to Borneo, staying in the Sabah region - **August 27**: return to Kuala Lumpur - **August 28 – September 2**: transfer to the east coast, with base on the Perhentian Islands for environmental volunteering and relaxing - **September 3–6**: last few days to be defined, either on the east coast or back in Kuala Lumpur - **September 6/7**: return flight ## Details Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, I'm considering whether to: - stay one night to rest and fly to Borneo the next day, or - take a domestic flight to Borneo directly the same night In Borneo, I’m planning to spend around 5–7 days in the **Sabah region**. I’ve read that it offers interesting experiences in nature, tropical islands, jungle, and biodiversity-related activities, but I haven’t decided yet what to include. After Borneo, I’d head to the east coast, focusing on the **Perhentian Islands**. I found an environmental volunteering opportunity there and would like to spend as much time as possible. The final days are open depending on connections and your suggestions. ## Questions 1. Is the Sabah region safe? 2. Are there enough interesting activities to stay for 5–7 days? 3. Is it too touristy or still authentic? 4. Is it easy to get around (scooter, taxi, public transport)? 5. Does it make sense to focus only on Sabah or also visit other parts of Borneo? 6.

My main doubt about this itinerary is the number of flights I’m taking because they can be quite tiring including all the security hassle. Albeit they are all quite short flights. They seem necessary between Penang > Langkawi > Phuket > Perhentian (via KL so two flights) > KK (via KL) > KL to fly home. Priority would be to keep a good diving spot and place to see some wildlife. Also feel like Penang is a must because I love Malaysian food! Phuket is included because I’ve never been to Thailand and thought it’s a good opportunity to get a glimpse whilst I’m nearby. Is there somewhere I should skip or spend less /more time in. I’m intentionally avoiding the east cost of Sabah as unfortunately it is still against my government’s advice to travel there. I’ve only just booked the flights so not entirely sure what I’ll be doing in each place so any activity suggestions would be great please. This is what I’m come up with based on previous Reddit posts/blogs: KL 4 nights Malacca 2 nights Ipoh 2 nights Cameron highlands 2 nights Penang 4 nights Langkawi 3 nights Phuket 5 nights Perhentian islands 4 nights Kota Kinabalu 4 nights Thanks!", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1kt69d8", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 14, "created_date": "2025-05-23T00:21:49+00:00", "author": "Loud-Sleep1211", "subreddit": "solotravel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt69d8/malaysia_phuket_itinerary_advice/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1kt69d8/malaysia_phuket_itinerary_advice/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 1395, "flair": "Asia", "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "search", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:34.438121+00:00"}

I(27M) will be traveling mostly solo to SE Asia(Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia) for the first time this July and August. I’ve traveled a good amount, but this will be my first time in the region. I will be flying into and out of Bangkok July 2nd-August 17th. I’m writing this with the intention of it being a flexible plan(subtract a day here, add a day there, etc). In terms of interests, I'm looking for a well rounded trip. I like history/cultural stuff, nature, diving, and food. I typically stay at hostels and love a social hostel with events that aren’t just bar crawls. I have mixed opinions about party hostels, I've been to some that I love and some that I hate.General feedback would be great but I have a few specific questions. 1. Am I spending enough time in Bangkok? Seems like a city with a lot to do that generates mixed opinions. With my current plan, I will likely spend 1 night at the start of my trip solo, 2 nights there with some friends, and 1 night at the end before I fly home. 2. If you were to add an extra day to either Pai or Vang Vieng(subtracted from a day in Koh Tao) which would you do? Would you do both? 3. When doing the slowboat from Chiang Rai-Luang Prabang should I get to Huay Xai the night before or the morning of? I really don’t want to be without a seat for many hours. Or should I splurge on a private boat? It seems like the private boats only leave a few days per week. Also, should I book a bundle ticket through Getyourguide or should I do it through a hostel/tour company on the ground? 4. Do I need more than 1 day in Chiang Rai? Currently planning on 1.5 or 2 before doing the Slow Boat to Luang Prabang. 5. Where should I go for my last week? Would love a beachy place that I can easily get back to Bangkok from. July 2nd-July 3rd Land at BKK at 5:30am Wat Arun and Grand Palace, get some street food or maybe a cooking class, K Panich(michelin star mango stick rice) maybe see if I can make some hostel friends. July 3rd-July 7th Bangkok-CM morning flight Temples, Elephants excursion, day trip to doi inthanon, markets, nightlife. July 7th-10th Chiang Mai-Pai morning bus, possibly rent a car Tipsy tubing, Pai Canyon, more nature stuff, debauchery July 10th-12th Pai-Chiang Rai by van/bus White Temple, Blue Temple, Lalita's Cafe Maybe head to Huay Xai the night before doing the slowboat July 12th-13th Huay Xai-LP slowboat, enjoy views, exist on the boat. Any recs for my night in Pakbeng? July 13th-17th Arrive in LP 5pm Kuangsi Waterfalls, Mount Phousi, Temples, Alms ceremony. July 17th-20th LP-Vang Vieng by train Nam Xay Viewpoint, Lagoons, tipsy tubing. Should I rent a car here or do tours? I’m not comfortable riding a scooter but am a confident driver. July 20th-21st VV-Vieniane Temples, victory monument, night market, Buddha Park. July 21st Vientiane-Bangkok-Surat Thani-Koh Tao by planes & ferry on Long travel day, arrive in Koh Tao and relax. July 22nd-28th Koh Tao PADI AOW cert, fun dives, hikes, snorkeling, relaxing, a smidgen of debauchery. July 28th-29th Koh Tao- Surat Thani-Bangkok by ferry and plane Meet up with my friends, river cruise, floating markets. July 30th-31st Bangkok-Ayutthaya by bus in the morning. Explore Ayutthaya both days Head back to Bangkok the night of July 31st. August 1st-5th Bangkok-Siem Reap by flight Angkor arch area(2 days), possibly a day trip to Mt. Kulen and other temples. August 5th-7th Siem Reap-Battambang by bus Bat Cave, killing cave, temples, bamboo train, etc. August 7th-9th Pnom Penh Killing fields, nightmarket, royal palace, temples. Part ways with friends. August 9th-16th Pnom Penh-? I have not decided where I would like to go for the last week of my trip but I would like for it to be on a beach, possibly somewhere that it is not the rainy season. It’d be cool to do at least a couple of dives as well. Contenders: Bali Koh Rong Malaysia(somewhere I can dive(maybe Tioman?) Da Nang August 16th Head back to Bangkok, fly to BKK, maybe crash in the airport. I’m from the US so if I leave the airport I think i’ll have to get a single entry visa.

{"id": "1l74nv8", "title": "Wrapping up a 2 month trip, another rambling trip report", "content": "I'm flying home right now, AMS > DTW (yay, free in-flight wifi, how far we've come), after almost two months of \"travel\". I put that in quotes, because quite a bit of this trip has been spent with family in Korea and also business travel, but also a decent amount of just going places by myself, occasionally catching up with friends in remote places. Started off with a business conference in Brussels, for which I arrived early to get in a full free day to explore the city. Then another free day afterwards to explore Bruges (HUGE fan of In Bruges, have wanted to visit since I first saw that movie!) and a bit of Ghent. Got some fantastic beer, chocolates, and frites (but no mussels!) while in Belgium. Next leg was flying out from AMS to Korea to visit family. Rather than take a few days in Amsterdam, as I'd be coming back this way later, I decided to spend a couple of days in Rotterdam instead, with a brief stop in Antwerp. Rotterdam is very close to Schiphol airport, and MUCH cheaper hotels and food. Walked a lot, took a ferry tour, ate some very good Surinamese food. AMS > TAE (Daegu) next, but with a day transit stop in Shanghai. First time ever to China, mainland or otherwise. One night isn't much, but I managed to explore some of downtown Shanghai, get some food, buy some pu'er tea for my mom. Finally in Korea to stay with my parents for about a month, working remotely, but also taking some time off. Also trying to avoid Seoul and ICN, seeing where I can go from TAE or PUS (Busan). Korea is literally second home, I go every year, and barely even feels like traveling (I keep a bedroom and office in my parents' home), but it's a fantastic hub for all sorts of Asian travel. Hit up an old college friend who lives in Kuala Lumpur, see if he's free to meet up somewhere, maybe Bangkok? How about HK instead? Never been there, but let's go for it! Very cheap flight from PUS, 4 days in HK, a day by myself to explore Wan Chai and Kowloon. I'm a big fan of 90s HK cinema and I find some awesome locations I recognized, like the mall from Chungking Express. Then meeting up with my friend, and his local friends, who are determined to show us, but especially me as a first time visitor, all the best eating and drinking spots. Dim sum, roast pork and goose, cocktails {including the #2 bar in the world according to some list), and beer out of a bowl. Back in Korea, nothing too exciting other than a lot of home cooking, obviously tons of great Korean food, but also cheap (compared to Japan and the US, that is), but excellent sushi. Next is Japan. Mostly for work, but also play. 2 days in Tokyo, and I go to Japan almost annually, Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, so these aren't super exciting for me. But then a week in Sapporo, including a full weekend to myself. First time in Hokkaido, and I'm in love! I could seriously live here. Some of the best food, especially seafood, but also ramen, and coffee and cocktails (Tokyo is admittedly better at these). And of course some amazing green tea (bought a ton of shincha and some aged sencha)! Also Hokkaido dairy, including an impressive range of cheeses. Just so much great food and drink the whole week! And now it's almost time to head back. Going the long way back (because it's cheaper than flying to the US), heading back to AMS from Sapporo, but another day's transit stop in Shanghai. I found a really friendly tea house right by my hotel, got served all sorts of oolong and Chinese (Yunnan) black teas (bought a bunch too). Final stop was 2 days in Amsterdam, and I finally got smart and rented a bike, just rode all across town hitting up a lot of museums, though the Van Gogh museum was sold out (pro tip, book minimum 3 days in advance!). Ate some herring, bought stroopwafels for friends, and now it's time to head home. So here I sit on a 8.5 hr flight and like most extended trips, I'm very much looking forward to sleeping in my own bed again. Jet lag will be annoying (was up at 2:30am Amsterdam time), and I have to get right back to work tomorrow. But also, the timer starts for my next solo trip (November, Romania and the Balkans... probably).", "content_type": "post", "parent_post_id": "1l74nv8", "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 5, "created_date": "2025-06-09T13:21:37+00:00", "author": "Ruffshots", "subreddit": "solotravel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l74nv8/wrapping_up_a_2_month_trip_another_rambling_trip/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l74nv8/wrapping_up_a_2_month_trip_another_rambling_trip/", "is_malaysia_related": true, "text_length": 4136, "flair": "Trip Report", "is_nsfw": false, "is_spoiler": false, "collection_strategy": "search", "collection_timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:37:47.291662+00:00"}

Also my other goal is to seek better career opportunity around the globe. And to have a safe haven of a country with less crime corruption, better education facilities , better health care, better infrastructure. Better standard of living basically. Do you guys have any better suggestions and advice given the context and my goal? I would really appreciate if you guys can give me some pointers on this. **Reason I shortlisted Uruguay:** 1. 0% tax for new resident foreign income. 2. Safest country in South America / Less Corruption 3. Fast route to PR (2 Years) / Citizenship in 5 years 4. Passport strength ranked top 25. Free/On arrival visa in 150 countries 5.

I’m running low on money and also need to head back home soon anyways. I haven’t really been traveling for a while now. For the past few months, I’ve mostly just been looking for stable places where I can focus on work, spending my time in Vietnam and Thailand. I’m building a few things and just need decent internet, a table, a chair, and a power outlet. I don’t need coworking spaces unless they come included as they would go over my budget. Right now I’m in Chiang Mai, renting a small but bright one-room apartment for about $9/day. My daily food budget is around $8.50/day, which covers two basic meals (like fried rice), stir fried morning glory, an americano, and snacks. This makes a total of only 17.5$ a day. I was thinking about spending my last 1.5 months in Tbilisi since I’ll be heading back to Europe soon anyway, so it would’ve cut the return trip in half. But based on what others here said, it sounds like it’s not really sustainable on my current budget. Europe in general seems too pricey for now. So I’m thinking of doing a visa run and staying in Chiang Mai or consider one of those places: * Pokhara, Nepal (Never been) * Penang, Malaysia (Never been) * Da Lat, Vietnam (even though I’m a bit Vietnam-fatigued) I'm open for other places. I’m not a fan of places packed with tourists (so no Bali). I’m more into laid-back, cozy vibes. Something like Luang Prabang by the riverside really worked for me with the beautiful old town. Beaches are fine too if they’re chill. So are mountains and forests and everything else. After 20 months of hostels and non-stop socializing, I’m pretty socially drained. I’m trying to slow down, focus on work, and recharge a bit. Socializing still matters to me, but I’m looking for a different kind of crowd now. Something more low-key and balanced. I’m okay with hostels if they have privacy curtains, but short-term apartments are ideal. AC is also important if it’s hot out, especially if I’ll be working from home. The same budget would be ideal (or less) but I can also go up to 1120$ a month of even 1200$ but only if really needed.
